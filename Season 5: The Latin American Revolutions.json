            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "We begin now our fifth cycle of episodes – the story of Spanish American independence. A story that is inextricably linked to the revolutions we’ve already covered. Because, as you may have noticed, though, I am narrating these revolutions in discrete units, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, this is all really one unfolding event rolling back and forth across the Atlantic as the modern world is slowly, painfully and oh so chaotically born. ",
            "But trying to cover all of Spanish American independence would be logistically insane. On the eve of Napoleon’s invasion of Spain in 1807, the Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere stretched from the southern tip of South America to as far north as, like, San Francisco. And by the time the wars of Spanish American independence ended a generation later, that enormous empire had cracked apart into fully 16 new nations: Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Mexico. To say nothing of the chunks that will wind up inside the United States. I estimate that it would take me at least 100 episodes to cover it all in full, and we are not going to do that. ",
            "So what are we going to do? Well, when you pull back to 10,000 ft and unfocused your eyes a little bit, you can really make out three principal theaters of action in the Spanish American wars of independence. In the far north, you have Mexico. In the far south, you have a connected axis that links Argentina and Chile, that includes Paraguay and Uruguay. And then in the middle, you have a big blob that will briefly become Gran Columbia and then devolve into modern Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. ",
            "Now, I’m not going to worry about Mexico right now, partly because it was geographically, politically, and militarily distinct from the South American liberation movements, and partly because I’ll be happy to tell you all about it when we get to the Mexican Revolution, whenever we get to the Mexican Revolution. ",
            "So that leaves us with events in South America where things are geographically, politically, and militarily connected. And indeed, when the armies of José de San Martín marched north from Chile to Peru, they will arrive just ahead of the armies of Simón Bolívar, who will be marching south out of Colombia. The two great generals would famously meet at a summit in July 1822, and you can’t get much more connected than that. ",
            "But of the two big South American theaters, there is no one who more personifies the liberation of South America than the liberator himself, Simón Bolívar. And no theater that better encapsulates the contentious and occasionally fratricidal process of Spanish American independence than the region that was once the Spanish Viceroyalty of New Granada and became, through Bolívar’s sheer force of will, an independent nation that historians call Gran Colombia. And so it is Bolívar and Gran Colombia that I will focus on. ",
            "So this run of episodes, then, is going to be like a series of concentric circles. The really detailed center will be Bolívar himself and the two principal nations he liberated, Colombia and Venezuela. Then the next circle of detail will cover the other Bolivarian states Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Panama is also in there, but Panama remains part of Colombia until Theodore Roosevelt comes down with his big stick in the 20th century. Then the next circle will be Argentina and Chile, which I plan to cover enough so that you know what’s happening without getting bogged down in the nitty-gritty details. And then the widest circle will bring in a few mentions of events up in Mexico, mostly to remind you just how vast the problem facing Spain was in the 1810s and 1820s. ",
            "So, having said all that, I am actually now going to spend the rest of today’s episode on the widest circle you’re ever going to get. An expansive overview of the Spanish Empire, how it got started, how it functioned, and who lived in it, covering its development through the so-called Spanish Golden Age until the Habsburg dynasty collapsed into a heap with the death of King Charles II in November 1700. Then next week, we’ll transition into a more detailed accounting of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, which will be the principal stage upon which the rest of our series will take place and which was created amidst the enlightened Bourbon Reforms that sought to strengthen and modernize the empire and in the process, help grease the wheels of revolution. After that, it will be off to the races. ",
            "And one last thing, of course, is my standard disclaimer that though I feel like I’ve got a pretty okay handle on Spanish pronunciation, I’ll more than likely botch a few things along the way. And even the stuff I get right is never going to be perfect and will always contain a hefty dose of Anglo-American ineptitude. ",
            "So to get things started here, we’re going to go back into the misty fog of post-Roman Iberia, that is modern Spain and Portugal, which, as you may or may not know, was invaded by North African Muslims in the early 700s. Most, but not all of the Iberian Peninsula then became a Muslim-ruled territory called Al-Andalus, and over the next few centuries became a front in the wider Mediterranean conflict between Islam and Christendom. Over the centuries, Christendom slowly pushed its way back into Iberia in a process later dubbed ‘the Reconquista’ or the reconquest. As Reconquista progressed, a patchwork of kingdoms took root in Christian Iberia: Castile, Leon, Aragon, Portugal, Navarre, Valencia, Catalonia, plus some other smaller feudal units thrown in for good measure. By the 1400s, all that was left of Al-Andalus was a rump Muslim territory called the Emirate of Granada down on the southwest coast. ",
            "Now, the big thing to note here is that at this point, Spain as such does not exist. These Christian kingdoms are separate kingdoms, and rivalries and alliances between the Iberian monarchies help define what is of actual interest to us here: the expansion of those Iberian monarchies off the peninsula and the subsequent creation of the first global empires. It was coastal Portugal who first started wandering out into the Atlantic in the late 1300s. They focused first on navigating south along the African coast, in part looking for trade routes to the Indies that did not require them to go through the Islamic territories that dominated most of the eastern Mediterranean. Now following close behind them, though, was the Kingdom of Castile, the largest and richest of the Iberian monarchies. In the early 1400s, Castile staked a claim to the Canary Islands, which lay off the west coast of Morocco, a claim naturally disputed by the Portuguese. ",
            "By the late 1400s, big changes in the balance of power in Iberia were afoot as an incredibly complicated game of marriage, intrigue, and revolt played out. To keep things simple, let’s just say that in 1474, King Henry IV of Castile died, and a struggle immediately broke out called the War of Castilian Succession. This conflict pitted Henry’s sister Isabella against Henry’s daughter Joanna, both of whom claimed the crown of Castile. Now, the future direction of Iberia was at stake here because Isabella was married to Ferdinand, heir to the neighboring Kingdom of Aragon, while Joanna was married to Alfonso V, the king of Portugal. But by 1476, Isabella had pretty much won the fight. At which point the war of internal succession segued into a war of external conflict between Castile, now linked to Aragon, and the jilted Portugal. ",
            "In 1478, Isabella then authorized a major push against Portuguese hegemony in the Atlantic. She initiated the conquest of the remaining Canary Islands, but more importantly, she wanted to move in on the recently discovered and highly lucrative Gulf of Guinea on the African coast. The Castilians outfitted a convoy of 35 merchant and naval vessels to sail down and assert Castilian rights to navigation and trade. And we’re talking here about gold, ivory, pepper, and, of course, our first batch of Sub-Saharan African slaves. To handle what they hoped would be a major haul of goodies, the Castilians established a receiver of customs in the port of Seville. Merchants were able to obtain a royal license to take part in the expedition that obligated them to turn over 20% of their profits to the Crown, thus establishing what became a standard feature of Spanish imperialism – the royal fifth. But while the Castilian fleet sat anchored off the coast of Africa with a fortune in their holds, 11 Portuguese ships launched a surprise attack and captured the entire Castilian fleet without losing a man. ",
            "OK, so why am I telling you all this? Where’s Bolívar? I’m telling you all this because as a direct result of this battle of Guinea, the Castilians and Portuguese signed the Treaty of Alcáçovas in 1479, which did two really important things. First, it recognized Isabella and Ferdinand’s claim to the Castilian throne. And second, it established Portuguese hegemony over, like, the entire Atlantic Ocean. A latitudinal line was drawn just south of the Canary Islands, which the Portuguese agreed to let the Castilians keep, beyond which the Portuguese would have a sole and undisputed claim to navigation and trade. All of this was then duly ratified by the Pope, who, among other things, was basically Europe’s notary public. ",
            "That same year, 1479, Ferdinand’s father died and Ferdinand became king of Aragon. And then he and Isabella ruled Castile and Aragon together as co-monarchs. But critically, the two realms were not otherwise united. Now, most of the Iberian kingdoms and principalities had by this point developed permanent political councils called Cortes that functioned a lot like the French Estates General. They were convocations of the lords and clergy and various knights of the realm. These councils served as the guardians of the kingdom’s own laws and rights and privileges. And so, as the kingdoms of Spain became more unified under the coming Habsburg dynasty, the Habsburg monarchs are ruling a hodgepodge of territories, all of them with their own separate list of rights and duties. It’s a long time before you get anyone talking about the Kingdom of Spain, singular. It’s always the kingdoms of Spain, plural. And important for our purposes is that if a monarch was killed or incapacitated, sovereignty of his individual realm would devolve to the councils, a principle that will play a huge role in events after Napoleon overthrows the Spanish monarchy in 1807, which is the trigger for everything. ",
            "Okay, so with Castile and Aragon united and now at peace with Portugal, Isabella and Ferdinand then focused on completing Reconquista. And in 1482 began what turned out to be a decade-long offensive against the Emirate of Granada. And while they did so, an ambitious navigator from the Italian city of Genoa named Christopher Columbus started making the rounds, trying to gin up support for his plan to find a trade route to the Indies by sailing west. He nearly convinced the king of Portugal to back him, but the King’s advisers told him that Columbus had no idea what he was talking about. Now, contrary to the old myth, it’s not because they believed the world was flat. No thinking person thought that. But they had run the math and determined, quite correctly, that Columbus’s estimate of the distance to the Indies was wildly off the mark. Then, in 1488, came the fantastic news that a Portuguese explorer had finally rounded the Cape of Good Hope, establishing that there was indeed a sea route to the Indies around Africa. So no need for wild-ass adventures off into the west. ",
            "So Columbus then turned to Isabella and Ferdinand, but they too repeatedly turned him down. And it wasn’t until just before completing Reconquista that they had a change of heart. And so it is by sheer historical coincidence that 1492 marks both the end of Reconquista and the beginning of ‘la Conquista’ – the Conquest. Because it was shortly after the fall of Granada that Isabella and Ferdinand finally approved Columbus’s scheme. The final rationale for backing him being that the cost of failure was negligible. I mean, what, the guy just disappears over the horizon and never comes back? Big deal. But the possible profits of success were enormous. So they signed a document in April 1492 called The Capitulations of Santa Fe, that, among other things, made Columbus viceroy and governor of any territory he might happen to discover and admiral of the ocean sea. He also got to keep for himself 10% of any future riches acquired. And when, surprisingly enough, Columbus’s voyage turned out to be a success, Isabella and Ferdinand would come to regret signing such an expensive document. ",
            "Okay, so that gets us basically to where we began our cycle of episodes on the Haitian Revolution. Columbus makes his first voyage in 1492, discovering, among other things, the island of Hispaniola. Well, last time, we stayed fixed on Hispaniola to follow the story through as it became a colonial backwater, eventually allowing French buccaneers to occupy the western third of the island and then everything that follows from it. Well, this time we’re going to stick with the Spanish as they abandon Hispaniola and turn their attention to, well, everything that we’re about to now talk about. ",
            "So, as I mentioned, Columbus had once pitched his project to the King of Portugal. And when he returned from his first voyage, he stopped in Lisbon and told the king all about what he had found, which naturally led the king to get all riled up, pull out his copy of the Treaty of Alcáçovas and write an angry letter to Isabella and Ferdinand claiming legal title to Columbus’s discoveries. This led to a furious round of diplomatic negotiations that culminated in June 1494 with the signing of the pivotal Treaty of Tordesillas. Once again, of course, notarized by the Pope. ",
            "Now, this was a mighty fateful treaty, to say the least. Portugal was mostly focused on protecting their claim to the African coast and they demanded the latitudinal demarcation line south of the Canary Islands not be disturbed. In exchange, they agreed to a longitudinal line ultimately drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, Portuguese possessions off the west coast of Africa. This new north-south running line confirmed Portuguese hegemony over the African coast. But what no one realized at the time was that it left all of North America and all but the Brazilian bulge of South America on the Spanish side of the line. So, yes, the Treaty of Tordesillas sets up everything that comes next. And also, yes, there are a few maps up at revolutionspodcast.com to help you make sense of all this. ",
            "So while those negotiations were still underway, Columbus went ahead and took his second voyage in 1493. This one was a full-blown colonization project: 17 ships carrying about 1,200 men of various means and trades, who were then deposited on Hispaniola. Columbus’s third voyage then came in 1498, which was one part supply run for the beleaguered and angry colonists of Hispaniola and one part voyage of further exploration. And here we do get to a turning point in the history of the Spanish Empire, because on the third voyage, Columbus hit mainland South America, specifically the northeast coast of Venezuela. ",
            "Now, the other turning point here is that when Columbus finally arrived in Hispaniola, he found the inhabitants there totally hated his guts. And the longer he stayed there, the more they hated his guts. Accusations of mismanagement and cruelty had already filtered back to Isabella and Ferdinand, who used the opportunity to try to get out from under the comically wide-reaching Capitulations of Santa Fe. In 1499, they sent a new governor to Hispaniola to investigate the charges against Columbus. And in 1500, Columbus was heading back across the Atlantic, in chains. Now he’s going to get out from under this cloud and make one more voyage in 1502, that was quite a disaster. Before finally dying in 1506, his heirs would then spend the next 30 years suing the Crown of Castile to force them to honor the Capitulations of Santa Fe. But let’s not fall down that rabbit hole. ",
            "As Columbus was being pushed out of the picture, Isabella and Ferdinand then handed the future management of their new world territories to a bishop named Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca. Fonseca helped organize Columbus’ second voyage, and from that point on, so 1493, until his death in 1524, Fonseca was essentially the supreme authority over what was then being called the West Indies. Under his direction, some of the mainstays of Spanish imperial policy were born. ",
            "In 1503, for example, the Casa de Contratación was born, literally the House of Trade, and established in Seville giving them a monopoly over the incoming and outgoing trade with the New World. The House of Trade took over the licensing of expeditions, collected colonial taxes, maintained all the charts and maps and records and claims and, most importantly, made sure the Crown always got the royal fifth. ",
            "Then, in 1511, Bishop Fonseca established a permanent standing Committee of the Indies that was nested inside the Council of Castile. Because, to be really clear here, the voyages of Columbus were chartered through the Crown of Castile, and so Castile’s council claimed jurisdiction over the West Indies. ",
            "So over the next 30 or 40 years, you get the heyday of the Spanish conquistador. Now, conquistador is kind of a catch-all label but it does refer to a very specific system of private individuals acquiring a royal license to explore, conquer, occupy, and exploit lands in the Spanish West Indies. These guys would underwrite their own expeditions and recruit men by offering profit-sharing contracts, one-fifth, as always, reserved to the Crown. At the moment, though, very little thought was given to, like, establishing a thriving global trade network or making peaceful contact with existing civilizations for the mutual benefit of yada, yada, yada. The point was to find gold, silver, pearls, and riches. The conquistadors were treasure hunters. Ruthless, cold-blooded, vicious treasure hunters. And every further expansion of their efforts inevitably begins with a rumor that just over the horizon is a city made of pure gold. ",
            "So we’re not going to get into a play-by-play of the various conquistador expeditions, although they are infinitely fascinating. But as they fanned out across North, Central and South America, the island of Hispaniola went from principal capital of the Spanish West Indies to forgotten ghost town. I mean, hell, Vasco Núñez de Balboa stumbled onto the Pacific Ocean in 1513 and claimed the whole damn thing for Spain. The Spanish officially had bigger fish to fry. The Conquest was underway. ",
            "The two most important conquests were those in Mexico and Peru. In 1519, Hernán Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico and made contact with the thriving Aztec empire that ruled Central Mexico. And though Cortés only led a few hundred guys by 1521 the densely populated inner Aztec realms lay prostrate at his feet thanks to a combination of treachery, gunpowder, smallpox and measles. Then, a few years later, Francisco Pizarro got permission to start exploring the west coast of South America and in 1532 he made contact with the thriving Inca Empire that ruled most of the Andes Mountains. Following the same playbook as Cortés, Pizarro employed a deadly combination of treachery, gunpowder, smallpox, and measles to overthrow the Inca and take control of their territory, though technically, the conquest of the Inca would take until 1570 to complete. ",
            "Now, all of this, not just the conquests of Mexico and Peru, but all of it taken together, came at a devastating human cost. Everything we know about the existing population of the Amerindians, and for simplicity’s sake, I’m going to use the term Amerindian, even though it is terribly inadequate as a term to describe all the native inhabitants of what becomes the Spanish Empire. Anyway, everything we know about their population numbers is guesswork, but it was probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 million people. After Columbus arrived, that population collapsed, with estimates of the brutal reduction running as high as 90%, thanks to that poisonous cocktail of treachery, gunpowder, smallpox, and measles. ",
            "Now, the reason Mexico and Peru are so important was, of course, because of the silver mines that they contained. From the beginning of the Conquest, conquistadors were shipping loads of treasure back home, but it was mostly extracted from crafted items they had either traded for or, as often as not, outright stolen from the native communities that they then destroyed. Anything of remarkable beauty might be kept in its original form, but most of it was melted down into bars or coins. But Mexico and Peru both held massive silver deposits that, once discovered, fundamentally changed the shape of the global economy. By the 1540s, the great Mexican silver mine at Zacatecas had been identified and was fully operational by the late 1580s. And then, down in Peru, the great silver mine at Potosí was opened in 1545. And these were just the two biggest mines, and smaller operations augmented Spanish silver mining across the empire. The Spanish American mines absolutely flooded the world market and wound up producing something like 85% of the world’s silver. ",
            "Now, the ironic thing here is that all this silver produced what’s known as the Spanish Golden Age, an age that coincides with the arrival of the Habsburg dynasty and their unification of the Spanish Crown, which ruled now the kingdoms of Spain. So the Habsburgs were, of course, one of the most important royal houses in the history of Europe, who had come to dominate the Holy Roman Empire through their Austrian branch, while the Spanish branch is being formed right here, right now, in the early 1500s. Isabella and Ferdinand’s daughter Joanna married a Habsburg prince named Philip the Fair. And in 1500, they had a son named Charles, then some murky convulsions unfolded, but with Joanna suffering from some kind of undiagnosed mental illness. But long story short, Isabella died in 1504, Philip the Fair died in 1506 and then Ferdinand died in 1516, and 16-year-old Charles inherited their claims to everything. So, in his own right, he now had claims to sovereignty almost the entire Iberian Peninsula, save principally for Portugal, unifying what was now being called the Spanish Crown. ",
            "But this Charles was not just the grandson of Isabella and Ferdinand, he was also the grandson of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. And when Maximilian kicked off in 1519, now 19-year-old Charles spread out some massive bribes and got himself elected Holy Roman Emperor, which is why he is principally referred to in history books as Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Now, Charles V is a hugely important figure in European history, thanks in part to the great heaping loads of silver now coming in from his growing empire in the New World, which he controlled thanks to his direct claim to the throne of Castile. That royal fifth was now gob-smackingly enormous. And it was all his to do with as he liked. And mostly what he liked to do was fight wars against the French. ",
            "Now, we’re not going to get lost in all that. Instead, we’re going to head back over to the growing Spanish Empire and get an idea of how it functioned and how it propped up the Spanish Golden Age, which I mean, really ought to be called the Spanish Silver Age. In 1524, Charles officially peeled the Indies out from being a subsidiary committee of the Council of Castile and made it its own sovereign unit. So from the King’s administrative perspective, his American empire was now run through a Council of the Indies, who themselves ran things through the Casa de Contratación, the House of Trade, located in Seville. ",
            "Now, from the time of Columbus’s arrival, a local administration in the West Indies was overseen by the governor of Hispaniola. But in 1511, the Crown had exported an institution of longstanding tradition in Iberia to help him govern: the ‘audiencia’. The audiencia is a super important institution – a small governing council of leaders who wielded combined legislative, judicial, and executive authority. Now, though the audiencias are about to become technically subordinate to the viceroys, more of them will be planted over the years. And this network of audiencias became the political and administrative backbone of the Spanish Empire. Eventually, there would be, among others, audiencias located in Mexico City, Bogotá, Caracas, Quito, Lima, Charcas, Santiago, and Buenos Aires. Do those sound familiar? They should. They are today the capitals of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. And they became the capitals because that’s where the audiencias were. ",
            "But the Council of the Indies decided that direct rule by the audiencias, basically government by committee, was too unwieldy to be the final, final authority. And so they reformulated things again, creating first the Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1535, and then the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1542. The Viceroyalty of New Spain had jurisdiction over all the territory in North America, down into Central America, and then also including the Philippines, which were charted and acquired in the 1540s. The Viceroyalty of Peru then had jurisdiction over the whole of Spanish South America. Now, the viceroy was, like it sounds, a royal emissary exercising royal sovereignty. And one thing worth noting here is that New Spain and Peru were referred to as kingdoms rather than colonies. Nothing was called a colony, at least not until the Bourbon Reforms that we’re going to talk about next week. ",
            "Now, along with the state, of course, comes the church. And wherever the conquistadors went, they brought with them Catholic missionaries who saw it as their duty to convert the heathen natives to the true faith. Now, at first, this process went great, at least that’s what the missionaries thought. But then it turned out that the Amerindians were just incorporating the Christian god into their broader pantheon of deities, and that wouldn’t do at all. So a process of slow cultural annihilation was undertaken by the dual power of the church and the state, which, given the strong Catholic nature of the Spanish monarchy, were often represented in one and the same man. ",
            "Now, in the first stage of the Conquest, this process manifested in the encomienda system, which we talked about very briefly in Episode 4.1. That’s where native groups would be placed under the protection of a Spaniard, usually as a reward for his service on some expedition or another, and then he would protect them by forcing them to work and make him rich. Now, these guys were supposed to see to the religious education of their charges. But the encomiendas weren’t generally too troubled with what god these people worshiped as long as they got to work. Because although these unfortunate Amerindians were not technically owned, this was de facto slavery. And as I also mentioned in Episode 4.1, a priest named Bartolomé de Las Casas, who had himself once been an encomienda, grew progressively distressed about what he was witnessing and he started to petition the Crown to protect the Indians as a father would protect his children. De Las Casas finally succeeded with his long campaign on behalf of the Amerindians, and in 1542, Charles V and the Council of Indies promulgated new laws that they called the ‘New Laws of the Indies for the good treatment and preservation of the Indians’. Thanks to these New Laws, the scope and power of the encomienda system was severely curtailed. It took a while to implement in full, but the New Laws do mark the end of the most exploitative era of the encomiendas. Of course, De Las Casas also suggested lessening the horrors inflicted on the Amerindians by importing slaves from Africa to do their work, which helped kick off the flood of African slave labor across the Atlantic. He came to regret that, too. ",
            "But though the encomiendas were being phased out, that did not mean life suddenly got great for the conquered Amerindians. And indeed, the Spanish really just moved on to an ever-so-slightly less exploitative system. Once the new laws were promulgated, full-blooded Amerindians were classified as minors in Spanish law and then resettled in communities called ‘reductions’, as part of a program to instruct these child Indians on the proper mode of European living and religion. These reductions, though, would be headed by a native leader who would be responsible for making sure that his people stayed in line, paid the tribute that the Crown now imposed upon them, and that they showed up for their forced labor duties, because ditching the encomienda did not mean ditching forced labor. The Amerindians were forced to provide free labor for all manner of public works projects, which meant most especially working in the mines. At the height of its operations, for example, the Peruvian silver mine at Potosí was run by upwards of 200,000 laborers. ",
            "Now, the Spanish Empire was not entirely run by forced Amerindian labor. They were now augmented by African slave labor and even, get this, paid wage labor. ",
            "So as the Spanish Empire grew up, the native populations and culture were slowly eradicated and then merged with the arriving white Spaniards and black Africans, neither of whom arrived with many women in tow. As the three principal races, that is, Spanish white, African black, and native Amerindian started intermixing, a racial classification system, just like the one we saw grow up in Saint Domingue, soon developed to determine the social status of all the mixes and matches that arose. By the end of the Spanish Golden Age, a pretty clear hierarchy had developed. ",
            "At the very top of this hierarchy, were ‘the peninsulares’ – whites born in Spain. Beneath them were ‘criollos/creoles’ – whites born in the Americas. And I should mention that while ‘Creole’ really refers to anyone and anything native to the Americas, in the Spanish context, ‘criollo’ is all but synonymous with whites born in America. Below them were mestizos, mixed-race children of whites and Amerindians, that is, a white man and a native woman. And critically here, if you had any white blood at all, that released you from the legal burdens imposed by the Spanish authorities on full-blooded Amerindians, the tributes, the forced labor, and more than a few native women found a white man whose blood could release her children from de facto bondage. Then there were the African slaves coming into it. And you have, just like in Saint Domingue, ‘mulattos’ (the mix of one white and one black) and then further on through the ‘quadroons’ and ‘octoroons’. Collectively, mixed-race black and whites are called ‘pardos’. Below them were ‘zambos’, which was a mix of black and Amerindian. And all of these mixed-race people were collectively called ‘castas’, because of their inferiority in the caste system. So below all of them were then the full-blooded Indians, free blacks, and at the very bottom, black slaves. ",
            "Now, this is all important because while the American Revolution resulted in a system of white supremacy, and the Haitian revolution resulted in a system of black supremacy. The Spanish American Revolution will result in a system of total and complete racial color blindness. And though the political proclamations and social propaganda was never really achieved in practice, the color blindness of post-Spanish America remains a really important ideological principle. ",
            "So all of these people combine to work in and administer the economic system of Spanish America. From the very lowest slave working in the worst conditions in the mine up through the very senior peninsulares, viceroys and governors, all of them kept under pretty tight control and all of their work directed to enrich the Spanish Crown. As I mentioned, all exports to and imports from the Americas had to run through the port of Seville, where the House of Trade could monitor everything. The port cities in the Americas were forbidden even from trading with each other, as that might tend to keep wealth in the New World rather than shipping it back to enrich the Old World. ",
            "To keep shipments to and from Spain safe from British and French and Dutch pirates who were now roaming the waters, the Spanish developed a convoy system: these huge trade fleets protected by the Spanish Navy. And by the late 1500s, they also had established a twice-yearly shipment to and from the Philippines. The famous ​​Manila galleons would depart from Acapulco on the Pacific Coast of New Spain, loaded with silver. They would then land in Manila, trade all that silver for Chinese spices, and then come back to Acapulco. Chinese goods would then be transferred overland to Veracruz, the principal port city on the Atlantic side of New Spain and from their ship to Seville. This Chinese trade was another boon to Spanish economic fortunes and is also how 40% of all silver minted in the Americas winds up in China. And it was in describing this sprawling Spanish trade network that you first get the old saw about, quote, “the empire upon which the sun never sets”. ",
            "Now, what I just described was essentially the political and economic system that will run the empire for the whole rest of the Spanish Golden Age, which, as I mentioned, collapses along with the Habsburg dynasty at the end of the 1600s. So let’s hop across the Atlantic again and finish off today’s episode by finishing off the Habsburgs. ",
            "In the mid-1550s, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, proceeded through a series of planned abdications to relinquish his various titles. And in 1556, Charles’s brother became Holy Roman Emperor. And then Charles’s son Philip inherited the Spanish Crown. Now, at that point, Philip was also technically the King of England, thanks to his marriage to Queen Mary in 1553. But that only lasted until 1558, whereupon she died and he was politely asked to take a hike. ",
            "So King Philip II of the Spanish kingdoms kept up his father’s passion for waging war and cast himself as the great defender of Catholicism, battling the forces of the Protestant Reformation on the one side and the Muslim Turks on the other. And this is pretty much where all that silver is going to go because he needs to pay for armies and navies to fight his wars. He was, for example, the principal financier for the Holy League’s Navy that soundly defeated the Turks at Lepanto in 1571, one of the greatest naval battles of all time. But Philip did manage to add to his revenue streams, and just a few years later, he snuck in a successful claim to the Portuguese throne when the Portuguese were in the midst of a succession crisis. And so, in 1581, Philip was also made king of Portugal, uniting the crowns of Spain and Portugal and all of their respective overseas holdings under one crown for the next 60 years. ",
            "So though King Philip II was, like, richer than God, he was constantly short of cash. It all just disappeared into the hands of his creditors the minute it showed up in Seville. Spanish finances were mismanaged to the point where Philip had to repeatedly declare bankruptcy and stiff the men he owed money to, which he did in 1557, 1560, 1575, 1596. Now, we’re not going to wander into this, but all of that played a huge role in the Dutch war of independence, as the Dutch rebelled against the Spanish Habsburgs, a conflict that runs from 1566 to 1648. Because while Spanish credit was now crap, Dutch credit was awesome and getting awesomer. ",
            "Phillip’s fortunes then took a further hit when his rivalry with Queen Elizabeth of England led him into another one of the great naval battles in history. Because in 1588, Philip dispatched the famous Spanish Armada, which mother nature and the English then proceeded to sink to the bottom of the deep blue sea. So after Philip II died in 1598, the 1600s then turned into one long stretch of stagnation and decay overseen by his heirs. All the Spanish Crown’s profits from their empire were immediately being handed over to creditors or used to purchase goods from the rising commercial industries of neighboring countries because the massive amounts of Spanish silver brought into the country was causing inflated prices for home industries, but making import super cheap, which totally arrested the economic development of the Iberian Peninsula. ",
            "Meanwhile, the rising Dutch and English who were taking advantage of all this started growing their own overseas empires and ignoring those Spanish claims laid out in the Treaty of Tordesillas. And then the French got into the act, and suddenly everyone was becoming a colonial power, and the Spanish and the Portuguese were fast losing traction. ",
            "So after its peak during the reigns of Charles and Philip in the 1500s, the subsequent reigns of Philip III, Philip IV, and Charles II that spanned the whole length of the 1600s was just one long decline. They got sucked into the Thirty Years’ War, and in not a good way. The ministers of Philip IV tried to strengthen the Crown’s central authority to cope with this war and instead triggered revolts in Portugal and Catalonia. The former successful, the latter crushed. And then, even after the Thirty Years’ War ended, a further war with France dragged on until 1659. Well exhausted by now, the Spanish monarchy was slipping into full second-rate power status, a process greatly accelerated by the long and torturous reign of King Charles II, who inherited the throne at the age of three in 1665. The problem was that Charles II was physically and mentally disabled, possibly thanks to Habsburg inbreeding, but nobody really knows. During his reign, men and women who acted as regents and caretakers of the monarchy just used it as an excuse to make themselves and their friends rich. So by the time Charles II finally died childless in November 1700, the Spanish Crown and the Spanish empire were utterly, completely morbid. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So, last time we did a big, expansive overview of the origins of the Spanish Empire up through to the end of the Habsburg era. And before we go any further, yes, I did biff the year of the Spanish Armada. It was of course 1588, not 1580. Sorry about that. It has been corrected. Well, today we’re going to cover the Empire as it undergoes reform under a new Bourbon dynasty. But we will do so with a particular interest in the Spanish domains that will, in the course of time, become Gran Colombia. Domains that emerge out of a new Viceroyalty that the Bourbons will establish: the Viceroyalty of New Granada. What began as something of an imperial backwater started to finally flourish a bit by the end of the 1700s. Just in time for everything to go to hell. ",
            "So, as we established last week, Christopher Columbus was the first Spaniard to hit mainland South America. On his third voyage in 1498, he ran into the continent near the mouth of the Orinoco River in what becomes northeast Venezuela. He then continued along the north coast until he hit a little group of islands, the biggest of which he dubbed Margarita, and upon which he discovered an extremely rich pearl bed, which would be the focal point of early Spanish interest. But that early Spanish interest would be undertaken behind Columbus’s back. By this point, the Spanish Crown was unhappy with both Columbus and the capitulations of Santa Fe. And so, without Columbus’s knowledge, Bishop Fonseca (remember, he’s the minister who basically ran the first phase of Spanish exploration and settlement in the Americas) launched further expeditions led by men who had taken part in Columbus’s first two voyages and who now wanted to strike out on their own. So in 1499, three ships under Alonso de Ojeda followed the route of Columbus’s third voyage and then kept going along the north coast of South America, eventually reaching the Gulf of Venezuela and then down through a narrow strait into the great lake of Maracaibo. There is a map of this all at revolutionspodcast.com. ",
            "Ojeda is the man officially credited with naming this region Venezuela, though I’ve seen two stories explaining why. The first is that it was just a riff on an indigenous name for the area. The other is that it reminded an Italian cartographer on Ojeda’s expedition of the Italian city of Venice. That cartographer was, of course, none other than Amerigo Vespucci, who would, thanks to the maps of the New World he wound up producing on this and future voyages, got his own name attached to the continent of the Western Hemisphere, which we now call the Americas. ",
            "And then, in late 1499 and early 1500, another expedition under Rodrigo de Bastidas took two ships further west, trying to get a handle on the scope of the Caribbean basin and always looking for that eternally elusive sea lane to China. Bastidas discovered the mouth of a huge river that he dubbed the Magdalena. And then he kept sailing down until he reached the Gulf of Urabá, which is the body of water that serves as the pivot between South America proper and the Isthmus of Panama. Recognizing that they were dealing with an enormous landmass here as opposed to just another island, this northern stretch of South America got dubbed Tierra Firme, or the mainland. And then, as the Spanish subsequently spread out across Tierra Firme and Central America and the Gulf of Mexico, all of these possessions started getting short handed as the Spanish Main – the Spanish mainland as opposed to their island possessions, in case you’ve ever heard the term Spanish Main and wondered what it meant. ",
            "But though these parts of future Venezuela and Colombia were the first mainland territories charted and settled, Spanish interest would quickly dwindle as the conquests of Mexico and Peru drew their attention to more potent and immediate riches. The islands off the Venezuelan coast, particularly the pearl beds, were, as I said, the principal focus of early settlement. The Spanish built a fort on the small island of Cubagua that underwent frequent bouts of abandonment and resettlement, as did their attempts to plant a base on the mainland. ",
            "But in 1515, the Spanish did finally plant what becomes the oldest permanently occupied European settlement in South America: Cumaná. And it is still there today. Then, a decade later, in 1528, the whole region actually falls under the authority of a German banking house run by the Welser family, and I am not kidding about this. They had lent a huge load of cash to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and in return, this German banking house got a license to exploit the province of Venezuela, which they tried to do, hiring mostly Spanish mercenaries to maraud around looking for treasure. But these mercenaries mostly came up empty. And eventually, the cruel reputation of the Welser regime got bad enough that King Philip II ultimately revoked their license to exploit the province of Venezuela in 1556, which also neatly coincides with his first declared bankruptcy in 1557. ",
            "And over on the Colombian side, Rodrigo de Bastidas eventually founded the port of Santa Marta. But he did not do so until 1525, because early attention in the region had shifted over to the Isthmus of Panama and its short land route to the Pacific. Then, in 1533, another port called Cartagena was founded, and ultimately, it would be Cartagena that became the principal port of the region. ",
            "So it was not until the 1530s that expeditions finally started heading out into the interior, specifically up the Magdalena River. Expeditions that always hovered around the famous legend of El Dorado, one of those cities made of gold that was always just over the next horizon. So in 1538, the Spanish launched a torturous expedition to go all the way up to the headwaters of the Magdalena. Eight hundred men set out, and only two hundred made it to the end. They did not find El Dorado, but they did run into the most advanced Amerindians in the whole region, who lived in settled agricultural communities, though nothing on the scale or sophistication of the Inca and Aztec. The Spanish then proceeded to conquer everything in sight and renamed the whole territory New Granada. And in 1538, they plopped down a city that was officially called Santa Fe, but would become known to all by a mangling of the native word for the area: Bogotá. So, 1538, that’s the founding of Bogotá. ",
            "Around the same time, the further expeditions were then traveling up and down the Orinoco River in Venezuela, but all were similarly coming up empty in the search for El Dorado. The region between the coast and the Orinoco River, for example, turned out to just be huge stretches of worthless grassland, run through with river beds that were flooded out between May and October and then bone dry from November to April. The whole swath of territory being filled with roughly one gillion bugs, but no precious metals. ",
            "But though El Dorado was never discovered, decent gold deposits were eventually uncovered in the interior of what is now Colombia. But what we’re talking about here is panning for gold in creek beds as opposed to massive mining operations. Certainly nothing like what was being discovered in Mexico and Peru. But light settlement did proceed, and in 1567, Caracas, the future capital of Venezuela, was founded, removed just enough from the coast to make life not quite so unbearably hot and disease ridden. And then I should mention here that a few years later, a Spanish noble who had been helping administer Hispaniola migrated down to Caracas and was awarded extensive land grants and political privileges. That noble: Simón de Bolívar. And for the next seven generations, the Bolívar family would form a core part of the inner circle criollo aristocracy in Venezuela, that is the white aristocracy born in the Americas. Until that long legacy fell onto the slender shoulders of a reckless youth who also inherited the name of the family’s original patriarch, Simón Bolívar. ",
            "So from that point on, a Spanish settlement and interest was pretty much confined to the coasts. Aside from Bogotá and the gold producing regions, the interior was pretty much ignored by the state and left instead to the church. Catholic missionaries started moving in to convert the native Amerindians, first Franciscans and Dominicans, and then eventually the Jesuits, who we will talk about more at the very end of today’s episode. The only export of any real value coming out of all this was the gold now being shipped out of Cartagena. And the population numbers do tell you where Spanish priorities lay. By 1700, Cartagena had maybe 5,000 people, Caracas had 6,000, Bogotá about the same. And this was at the same time that Lima, the capital of Peru, was pushing 40,000. So for the whole of the Habsburg era, the whole of what would become Gran Colombia, was not particularly important. But with the arrival of the Bourbons, changes in the balance of power back in Europe and pressure from arrivals in the Caribbean led the Spanish to take a more active interest in the region’s development. And to kickstart that discussion, we need to head back across the Atlantic to cover the chaotic transition from the Habsburgs to the Bourbons. ",
            "So, we left off last time with the unfortunate King Charles II of Spain, right on the brink of death in November 1700. Now, because Charles II was both developmentally disabled and sterile, everyone in Europe was super nervous about what was going to happen once he finally died. With no direct heirs to the Spanish throne, the matter was about to be kicked out into the Byzantine world of competing royal bloodlines, all of which were ultimately interconnected. And when it came to claiming the Spanish crown, it boiled down to two sides. On one side you have the great King Louis XIV, who had by now been ruling France for over 50 years. Louis himself was the grandson of King Philip III of Spain, and his wife was the oldest daughter of King Philip IV of Spain. Then on the other side, you have the Austrian Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, who had been Holy Roman Emperor now for over 40 years. Leopold I was also a grandson of King Philip III and married to the younger daughter of King Philip IV. The long rivalry between King Louis XIV and Emperor Leopold had helped define European politics for the last two generations. And they were about to have one last go of it over the Spanish succession. ",
            "Now, if things had just unfolded blindly, the death of Charles II would have kicked the line of succession over to his sisters. Since the older sister was married to Louis XIV, their children, so a bunch of French princesses, would now have the principal claim to the Spanish throne. But recognizing that a shift in the balance of power that enormous could not be allowed to just unfold blindly, rounds of diplomatic negotiations in the late 1690s tried to allocate Spanish holdings amongst various claimants to satisfy everyone’s ambitions, keep the balance of power, and somehow avoid a war when Charles II inevitably died. And in 1698, everyone finally did agree to a hypercomplex reallocation of territory and giving the Spanish Crown and its American empire to one of Leopold’s grandsons: Joseph Ferdinand, the Elector of Bavaria, who was all of six years old at the time. But unfortunately, that poor kid died a year later and the whole arrangement was undone. ",
            "At this point, eminent Spanish nobles were getting nervous about being swallowed whole by either the Austrian Habsburgs on the one hand, or the French Bourbons on the other. And so, as Charles II lay on his deathbed in late 1700, these nobles forced the dying king to fix his whole inheritance on a younger grandson of King Louis XIV, 16-year-old Philippe, Duke of Anjou. Now, a clause in the will stipulated that to claim the Spanish throne, Philippe had to legally disavow any future claim to the French throne. The Spaniards hoped this would induce the Austrian Habsburgs to agree to the deal, since it would preclude the much dreaded unification of Spain and France under a single king. When King Charles II finally did die in November 1700, Philippe headed over to Madrid and accepted his inheritance, becoming King Philip V of Spain. ",
            "Now, at this point, war maybe could have been avoided, but then King Louis XIV started making aggressive moves, advancing French troops, for example, into the Spanish Netherlands, which were not actually his, they were his grandsons. And then he also announced that he would not be removing the new King Philip V of Spain from the French line of succession, reraising the hideous specter of Franco-Spanish unification. This intolerable possibility alarmed the whole of Europe, which then descended into the War of the Spanish Succession that ran from 1701 all the way until 1714. Now, we are going to sidestep the intricate details of that conflict, but suffice it to say that the next 13 years of war pretty much exhausted everyone without coming to a decisive result anywhere. So rounds and rounds of diplomacy arranged a new balance of power everyone could live with. The upshot for us here is that King Philip V was confirmed as King of Spain, and he agreed to renounce all claims to the French throne. On top of that, his royal relatives in France agreed to renounce any future claims that they might make on the Spanish throne. ",
            "So the Bourbons now controlled both France and Spain, but they would not be united. To secure this arrangement, however, the Spanish Crown had to parcel out most of its European possessions to the other powers. And if you remember from our cycle of episodes on the French Revolution, this is the point in history when the British forced the Austrians to take on what was then called the Spanish Netherlands and what thus then became the Austrian Netherlands, or as I always called it, Belgium. Austria would then spend the next 75 years trying to give the Austrian Netherlands away until it all got rolled up into the wars of the French Revolution. ",
            "So that convoluted little tale that you probably did not follow in all of its details takes us to a place where the kingdoms of Spain are now firmly united under the Bourbon king, Philip V, who would proceed to rule, with one brief interruption, all the way until 1746. And though his European possessions outside Iberia were parceled out, he did retain sovereignty over the entire overseas Spanish Empire, which was still the largest and most lucrative in the world. Now finally free of war and without domains elsewhere in Europe to worry about, Philip and his Bourbon heirs would undertake what they hoped would be the revitalization of the Spanish Empire. Because at the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish Crown was all but bankrupt, its military resources were nonexistent, and it had no internal economic development to speak of. The Bourbons hoped to change all that. ",
            "To effect that change, the first thing we need to note is that the Bourbons brought with them a more modern view of an activist centralized monarchy, as opposed to that more limited hodgepodge of domains that the Habsburgs had been running. The Bourbons had a different idea of how the Spanish Crown should operate. So if you remember from last week, there was a lot of talk of Castile and Aragon, Navarre, Catalonia, and the Habsburgs then unifying the kingdoms of Spain, plural. The Habsburg royal title was in fact ‘King of the Spains and of the Indies’. While the Bourbons tellingly refashioned themselves as ‘King of Spain’, singular and ‘Emperor of America’, and as they progressed through their reforms, they always, always kept one eye on unifying their domains and centralizing political, economic and social authority. And this was a process that would culminate in the thoroughly enlightened despotism of King Charles III, who would rule from 1759 to 1788. ",
            "But since we are mostly interested in the American aspects of the Bourbon Reforms, we’re not going to worry too much about their work in Iberia and instead focus on their overseas domains. So in 1717, bureaucratic stagnation in the Casa de Contratación, the House of Trade, led Philip V to relocate the whole operation to Cádiz to give it a fresh start. And then in that same year, he created the Viceroyalty of New Granada. This third viceroyalty would occupy the middle territory between New Spain and the north, and Peru to the south, covering the future nations of Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, depending on the nebulous border between New Granada and Peru. Now, up until this point, the whole of Spanish South America was technically being run out of Lima, which meant that really, nobody was minding the store up in the north. And indeed, when the new viceroy arrived in his new capital of Bogotá, he discovered a hotbed of corruption and tax evasion, with local authorities conspiring with merchants to undervalue merchandise and turn a blind eye to outright smuggling. But though introducing a viceroyal government directly into the region seemed like a good idea in theory, in practice, the second viceroy, who came in in 1719, immediately started a letter writing campaign to shut the thing down. He said that New Granada and its adjacent provinces were not rich enough to support the effort and expense of maintaining a viceroyal government. And in 1724, the Council of the Indies agreed and the thing was shuttered. So not off to a great start. ",
            "But a few years later, tension between Spain and Britain exploded into a war that necessitated a vigorous defense of the Spanish Main. And so the Viceroyalty of New Granada was reformed in 1739. And though the capital would technically be Bogotá, the new viceroy, Sebastián de Eslava, would spend almost his entire run in the port of Cartagena. Eslava was a general in the Spanish army, and a damn good one, to be honest. And it was thanks to his efforts, strategic, administrative and tactical, that the British made absolutely no inroads during the subsequent war. ",
            "Now, for those of you who know a bit of history, you know that the war I’m talking about here is the War of Jenkins’ Ear. The origins of this war go back to the treaties that wrapped up the War of the Spanish Succession, because in those treaties, the Spanish granted a commercial monopoly to the British for traffic of African slaves into the Americas. The Spanish authorities suspected, quite rightly, that British merchants were using this conceited access to Spanish markets to smuggle in a whole bunch of other stuff they were prohibited from carrying. In 1731, one such merchant, Robert Jenkins, had his ship boarded and searched, and in the ensuing confrontation, the Spanish commander cut off Jenkins’ ear. Fast forward a few years, anti-Spanish feelings are running high in Britain, and the story of poor old Jenkins is revived. And he’s brought in to testify before Parliament, and according to what is likely an apocryphal story, he brought with him his pickled ear in a jar to show off to much dramatic gasping. This and assorted other grievances, real and imagined, led Parliament to all but force Prime Minister Robert Walpole to declare war on Spain in 1739. ",
            "So a British fleet under Admiral Edward Vernon was then dispatched to the Caribbean to attack Spanish holdings there, and he did a pretty decent job of it through 1739 and 1740. But really, Vernon was just building up ahead of steam for the really big attack he planned on the port of Cartagena in early 1741. For this operation, he mustered in Jamaica fully 186 ships and over 25,000 men. This is a really big operation. Ten thousand of those were regular army, twelve thousand were sailors, and then there were four companies of Virginians numbering four thousand total. One of those four companies was led by Captain Lawrence Washington, that is the beloved older half-brother of our old friend George Washington. And unlike many of his comrades, Washington managed to survive the coming ordeal, and when he came home to Virginia, he built a plantation on a hill beside the Potomac River that he named after his old admiral, Vernon, hence Mount Vernon. ",
            "The siege of Cartagena, though, turned out to be a complete disaster for the British, and a combination of the city’s excellent fortifications and yellow fever induced catastrophic casualties, a good 10,000 dead and another 7,500 sick or wounded, before the British withdrew in May 1741. But by that point, back in Europe, the War of Austrian Succession was now under way, and the War of Jenkins’ Ear was just folded in as a little side theater of that new long European war, as Spain wound up naturally allied with their cousins in France, who had joined Prussia in a fight against their common nemesis, the Austrian Habsburgs, who were allied now with the British and Dutch, among others. The war lasted from 1740 to 1748, and we are not going to worry about it one little bit. Instead, we’re going to keep right on trucking to the next big European war that does so much to alter the course of history in the Western Hemisphere, and which I have now concluded as the widest discrepancy ratio between historical importance and frequency of discussion: the Seven Years War. ",
            "So this will now be the fourth series in a row in which we have to talk about the significance of the Seven Years War and those seven years were 1756 to 1763. For the American Revolution, of course, it was British financial and political reforms introduced into their North American colonies at the end of the war, like after they kick out the French, that gets the ball rolling on American independence. For the French Revolution, the Seven Years War is the beginning of that diplomatic revolution of 1756. Remember? That was when a new British Prussian alliance forced France and Austria into an utterly unnatural and mutually loathed counter alliance. French hatred of the Austrian alliance played a major part in the early days of the French Revolution and ultimately helped drive the whole project off a cliff once the Girondans got everybody whipped up with war fever and declared war on Austria in April 1792. And then for the Haitian Revolution, remember that having lost all their North American possessions as a result of the Seven Years War, which every patriotic Frenchman naturally blamed on the Austrians, the French ministry tried to strengthen the metropolitan hold on its remaining Caribbean colonies by introducing a system of racial apartheid, which, of course, did nothing but spin that web of tension in Saint Domingue even tighter. ",
            "OK, so here we are once again talking about the role of the Seven Years War and the part it plays in the emergence of Spanish American independence. Seven Years War. Very, very important war. ",
            "So now, Spain did not immediately join the Seven Years War, but it did finally join the beleaguered French and Austrians in 1762, just in time for them all to get beat. But though the resulting settlement was catastrophic for France (they lose all their North American territories), it actually turned out not so bad for Spain, because while they had to give up Florida to the British, they managed to take over possession of the Louisiana Territory, which they were granted to pay off a war debt owed to them by the French Crown. And that’s how Spain winds up controlling Louisiana. That is, until Napoleon takes it away from them in 1800 and tries to use it as a centerpiece for a new French empire in the Americas, a dream that subsequently died of yellow fever in Saint Domingue in the summer of 1802. ",
            "But it was during the Seven Years War, though, that the great King Charles III ascended to the Spanish throne. Charles had been the King of Naples and Sicily since 1738, but he gave up those titles to become King of Spain after his half-brother Ferdinand died in 1759. King Charles III is one of the quintessential enlightened despots who emerged out of the bubbling intellectual cauldron of the Enlightenment, joining a cohort of contemporary reformist monarchs like Frederick the Great, and Catherine the Great, and the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. And it would be the sweeping reforms made by Charles III at the conclusion of the Seven Years War that would really help start to set the stage for the coming Spanish American Revolution. ",
            "Now, the point of the reforms was to strengthen and stimulate his new empire by introducing financial reforms to create a more efficient tax system, political reforms aimed at greater centralized authority, military reforms to empower the colonies to defend themselves, and economic reforms to dramatically increase the rational productivity of the whole enterprise. ",
            "Now, not all of these reforms originated with Charles III. In many cases, he was just expanding on pre-existing reforms or continuing with a process started by his predecessors. But it really all does come to a head under Charles III. And aware that you can’t just dive in with both feet into the center of an entrenched system and just start mucking around, Charles III and his Council of the Indies began at the margins and then worked their way towards the center. And at this point, the Viceroyalty of New Granada was still pretty much the margins. ",
            "So on the political front, the biggest innovation was the introduction of the intendants, a new type of official copied from the French example. The intendants and their staffs were salaried civil servants answerable directly to the Crown back in Madrid. And though technically subordinate to the viceroy, the proliferation of intendants made them independent powers in their own right, wielding a wide range of authority over justice, finances, legislation and economics. The proliferation of intendancies after the Seven Years War was greeted by the American criollo elite with a mixture of acceptance and resentment. Because, on the one hand, getting an intendant planted in your city, as, for example, Caracas did in 1776, well, that was a huge boon to the political and economic prestige of the local criollo elite. But at the same time, their practical access to political power started to wane, because unlike the old audiencias, which were heavily staffed by criollo nobility, the intendancies were typically staffed by peninsulares. And it wasn’t just the intendants themselves who were peninsulares, the growing bureaucracy they led was also staffed by peninsulares, but those guys were just low born civil servants, and those common bureaucrats now had authority over rich criollo nobility, which was not going to be a recipe for harmony in the socially conscious world of the Spanish elites. ",
            "Now, another ingredient that was part of no recipe for harmony was that one of the principal objectives of the intendants was a more efficient collection of taxes, and who likes to pay taxes? But to be fair, this was not some ham fisted shakedown. Charles III and his Council of the Indies could think of no better way to grow their tax base than to modernize and stimulate the whole Spanish imperial economy. And so, it’s immediately after the Seven Years War that you get a sea change in economic thinking. And so last time we talked about how everything was kept under very tight control and run through the single House of Trade. The American port colonies were not even allowed to trade with each other, barring a few exceptions here and there. Well, now everything is going to be loosened up. In 1763, American ports were finally allowed to deal in just single ship trade, as opposed to having to deal with the huge convoy system. Then, in 1765, the first of a network of the Economic Society of the Friends of the Country was founded to develop and promote modern economic thinking. And those societies then spread from Europe over to the Americas. And then, in 1778, comes the biggie: the Freedom of Trade Decree. The power of the Casa de Contratación was restricted, and 13 Spanish ports were now allowed to trade directly to the Americas. And even more critically, those American ports were now free to trade with each other. The intendants were also empowered to not send all of their tax receipts back to Spain, and instead, maybe reinvest a portion of it in improving roads and sanitation and the water supply, basically upgrading the entire civil infrastructure to facilitate greater productivity. ",
            "But free trade was not really free trade the way that we mean it today. This is all still rooted in mercantilist theories of a closed imperial trading system. So, free trade inside the Spanish Empire, but you’re still trying to block out the British and the French and the Dutch, at least as much as humanly possible. But even inside the Spanish Empire, it was not really free trade, because though the grand monopoly of the House of Trade was curtailed, it was really just being replaced with a plethora of smaller monopolies, covering either geographic regions or, like, an economic sector. The Crown itself, for example, had a monopoly on all tobacco trade, from the prices paid to farmers, to the prices charged to consumers. But though this was not ideal, it did do a much better job rationally allocating economic resources. And perhaps more importantly, it cut mightily into the contraband trade, which had always made a fortune, and avoided a fortune in Spanish taxes, by filling the inevitable gaps in the old closed off system. ",
            "But the Free Trade Decree was not universally beloved, because one of the big objectives of the decree was opening up American markets to newly emerging Spanish production in, for example, textiles. But the resulting flood of cheap goods from Spain into the Americas ruined many local merchants and manufacturers, which, as you can imagine, left them pretty ticked off. ",
            "But in the main, and especially from Madrid’s perspective, this was all a very big success. And the value of trade between Spain and the Americas increased 400% in value between the early 1780s and late 1790s.",
            "Now, since we’re interested in how this all shakes out for the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the whole of the political and economic reforms for the entire Bourbon era helped precipitate their rise in stature. So around Caracas, for example, large haciendas, that is, big commercial estates, had taken root, and they were now exporting wheat flour and then really started turning a major profit when they got in on the cacao boom. And then out in those worthless Venezuelan grasslands, cattle and horses introduced in the early days of the Conquest now roamed in wild herds, and a population of mostly mixed race cowboys had moved in and were making a go of it in hides and meats. And those cowboys are going to be really super duper majorly important, so please don’t forget about them. Caracas itself, meanwhile, had grown in importance and now sported both an audiencia and an intendancy. So, by the time our man Simón Bolívar was born in 1783, his native Venezuela was fairly well thriving. ",
            "Now, to defend this new, thriving economy, without that defense draining off all the profits, the Spanish also reoriented their military posture. It was simply too expensive to ship Spanish troops over to garrison the Americas. So the army started creating regiments drawn directly from the American population, and then to augment that local strength, they vastly expanded the existing militia system. Service in both the regular army and the militia became a principal avenue of upward mobility, and was especially attractive because it put the enlistee under special military law that was far more responsive and rational than local justice. It also trained generations worth of young men in the art of war, and then their sons tended to follow them into service. So when the wars of Spanish American independence got going in the 1800s, there was a deep well of military training and experience they could all draw from. ",
            "And then in 1777, Venezuela was upgraded again to become a Captaincy General, which meant that a senior military officer would now reside in Caracas who held independent authority over the region’s defenses. And that was just in time for Spain to join the European coalition that aided Britain’s North American colonies in their dramatic fight for independence. And as we will see next week, many young Venezuelan officers joined that fight and in particular helped capture Pensacola in 1781, including the man who will be at the center of next week’s episode, Francisco de Miranda. ",
            "Now, we’ll end today’s episode with one of the most controversial of Charles III’s reforms, a reform that caused widespread resentment in the Americas and helped begin the formation of a distinct American identity, especially in the upper classes. I am speaking of the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Spanish Empire in 1767. ",
            "Now, we haven’t talked about the Jesuits too much around here, but to be brief, they were a Catholic order formed in 1540, and were officially called the Society of Jesus. And the thing that makes the Jesuits unique is their belief in the value of a good education. When their order arrived in the New World, they brought with them that focus on education, and local elites were all too happy to send their sons off to get a Jesuit education. And beyond just educating the next generation of criollo elites, the Jesuits turned more than a few of those guys into the next generation of criollo Jesuits. ",
            "But the Spanish Crown was always a little concerned about the Jesuits. Though we haven’t talked about it, this is still the age of the Inquisition, when dogma, both political and religious, was enforced by force. You are not supposed to be reading heretical books, thinking heretical thoughts, or saying heretical things. Censorship in the Americas was officially pretty tight, though it was impossible to stop the spread of the really interesting books and ideas that were floating around out there, especially after the Enlightenment gets going. So the Spanish authorities attended to look at the Jesuits and that focus on education as a hotbed of heretical sedition. The Jesuits also happen to run by far the most humane of those Amerindian reductions that we talked about last week, and the Indians under Jesuit charge were generally left to live in their own manner without forced conversion to European modes of living, and the Jesuits constantly defended the Amerindians from Spanish abuse. ",
            "So in 1767, King Charles III decided to clear out the troublesome Jesuits by expelling them all from his empire. Go on, get out. You’re not welcome here anymore! But the thing to understand is that the Jesuits in the Americas were not peninsulares who had traveled to the Americas. They were now born and raised criollo. So we’re talking here about natives of Mexico and Venezuela and Peru being exiled from their homes and forced to relocate to some safe haven in Europe. And it’s during that exile, and thanks to their education, that these guys started developing and promoting the idea that there was such a thing as a purely American identity that was distinct from, and even superior to, the Spaniards who presumed to rule, despite the fact that it was clear to everyone that the strength of Spain was in America, not in Spain itself, which was a hopeless decrepit wreck. ",
            "One of the founding documents of Spanish American independence was, in fact, written by one of these Jesuit exiles, a Peruvian named Juan Pablo Viscardo. Exiled in London, he penned his famous Letter to the Spanish Americans, which explicitly promoted the idea of Spanish American independence. Now, of course, by then, he had the American Revolution to point to as an example. And then also the French Revolution is getting underway, and liberals across Europe are getting pretty excited about the possibility of remaking the world anew, and they might be willing to listen to what it might take to break Spanish America away from the Spanish. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So we’ve spent the last two episodes [5.01 and 5.02] laying a lot of groundwork, taking the Spanish Empire from a band of marauding conquistadors in the early 1500s to a modernizing mercantilist empire at the end of the 1700s. Well, today we’re finally going to get into the good stuff, at least in terms of the stuff we like to talk about here on the Revolutions podcast: protest, revolt and rebellion. Because, though, last week I just sort of described in the abstract the reforms implemented by King Charles III of Spain after the end of the Seven Years War, in the real world, those reforms were not going to be implemented without a goodly amount of protest, revolt and rebellion. ",
            "So the first precursor revolt we get to talk about is the Rebellion of the Barrios, and that is with two r’s, but please don’t make me try to roll my r’s. This rebellion blew up in 1765 in the city of Quito, which is now the capital of Ecuador. And it was triggered by the first round of post Seven Years War reforms, with two being particularly odious. First, stricter enforcement of the long established but long despised sales tax, and second, a tightening of the state’s monopoly on liquor production and sales. The criollo elite of Quito were incensed at the monopoly reforms, in particular, because they owned the sugarcane fields and facilities from which and through which the liquor was produced. Meanwhile, the mostly mixed race lower classes were ticked off that the sales tax was now jacking up prices everywhere. But it wasn’t just the liquor monopoly and the sales tax per se that were so odious. It was that the enforcement of both would be taken out of the hands of local contractors and put into the hands of salaried agents of the Crown, who are now those lowborn peninsulares civil servants we talked about last week and who are now being introduced in force. So the elites in Quito drafted a letter of protest to the viceroy in Bogotá, only to have the viceroy blow them off. Then, much to everyone’s surprise, everything escalated really super quickly. ",
            "On May 22, 1765, somebody started ringing the town bells, and thousands of mostly mestizos and Amerindian lower classes flooded into Quito. They converged on the tax offices and destroyed all the tax records. This sudden riot was then followed up a month later by an even deadlier uprising, with armed residents actually seizing control of the city. But in what would be a consistent theme of all these Spanish American uprisings, up through the early days of the wars of independence, the insurrectionaries repeatedly proclaimed their undying loyalty to the King of Spain and that they only fought his corrupt and malevolent agents, whose corruption and malevolence the King would no doubt be shocked to discover. And as a further expression of this sentiment, the insurrectionaries now wanted more than just tax and monopoly relief. They forced the cowed audiencia of Quito to expel all unmarried peninsulares and all nonresident peninsulares, period. So what had started as a simple tax revolt had turned quickly into an expression of local anger against evil peninsulare foreigners. ",
            "Now, amazingly, for whatever reason that is, I can’t actually find the reason, the viceroyal authorities in Bogota did not make a concerted effort to retake the rebellious Quito for a good year and a half. And it was not until September 1767 that they finally mustered some regular army troops to march over and bring Quito back into the official imperial fold. And then, just as curiously, the army was able to do so without incident. Now, I honestly have not been able to dig up too many details about the surprisingly long and then ultimately anticlimactic end to the Rebellion of the Barrios, but given the pattern of future uprisings, there had to have been some collaboration here between the viceroyal authorities and the local criollo elite of Quito to halt the spread of any further radicalism on behalf of the mixed race lower classes. It was one thing to protect elite economic privileges, but quite another to just turn the world upside down, and so thus ended the Rebellion of the Barrios. ",
            "Now, right smack-dab in the middle of all this, a similar wave of violent unrest started breaking out up in New Spain, specifically the region around Guanajuato, northwest of Mexico City. In 1766, locals erupted over a whole host of complaints. They were opposed to a new array of taxes and the stiffer collection of existing taxes, the influx of cheap goods from Spain that undercut local producers, and the forced extension of militia service. Eventually, a mob 6,000 strong stormed the city of Guanajuato and raided the royal treasury, just smashing the joint up. Then they proceeded to control the city for a good three days before finally dispersing. As with their cousins in far off Quito, the rebellious mob in Guanajuato swore that they were not rebellious at all. They shouted, “Long live the King!”, and asked only for the death of bad government. The Guanajuato riot of 1766 receded without further incident. But then everything re-exploded in an even wider spread series of protests the following year, when word came that the Jesuits had been expelled from the Empire. Remember, by now, most of the Jesuits are local sons, prominent local sons, respected, educated, with strong ties to both the elites and the lower classes. All across New Spain, and indeed all across Spanish America, protests and clashes and the occasional riot accompanied the forced expulsion of the Jesuit brothers. But it never coalesced into a broader, unified movement. And as with all of these precursor uprisings, temperatures did soon cool. But the tyrannical expulsion of the Jesuits would leave a lot of lingering resentment all across Spanish America. ",
            "Now, what I just described were just the most explosive incidents, and they were accompanied by varying degrees of resistance and resentment everywhere as this new round of Bourbon reforms was introduced after the Seven Years War. But while up in British North America, a bunch of anti-tax, anti-monopoly revolts during the 1760s led directly into a patriotic independence movement in the 1770s, down in Spanish South America, the 1770s turned out to be a time of renewed calm and order. But things did start to pick back up again in the early 1780s, and that was in part triggered by Spanish involvement in the American War of Independence. Now, as we all know that after the Battle of Saratoga, the French joined the American fight. But as I also very briefly mention in Episode 2.12, the French help nudge their European neighbors into helping them punch the British in the nose. And both the Dutch and the Spanish wound up pledging money and military aid. On the Spanish front, that meant mostly engaging in operations against the British down in the Caribbean. And then, as we’ll talk about in a minute, the siege and capture of Pensacola, Florida in 1781. To support the effort, the Crown wanted to raise a bunch of money from their American subjects, which meant, among other things, new taxes and further strengthening of various Crown monopolies, all of it being administered by those intrusive peninsulare civil servants. ",
            "So the first nascent rebellion got going in 1780 down in what is today Santiago, Chile. That is the conspiracy of the three Antonios. The first Antonio was a French born teacher and Enlightenment enthusiast named Antonio Berney. The second Antonio was another resident Frenchman who had emigrated to Santiago to make a fortune, Antonio Gramusset. And the third Antonio was a prominent criollo named José Antonio de Rojas. The conspiracy of the three Antonios was actually one of the most radical of all the precursor rebellions, because these three guys planned to overthrow the Spanish Crown, found an independent republic, and then proceed to abolish racial and economic classes, liberate the Amerindians from all of their obligations, and free the slaves. And as if that wasn’t ambitious enough, they then planned to move on to radical land redistribution. The conspiracy of the three Antonios was, in fact, so radical that it is often plucked out and cited as a precursor not just to Spanish American independence, but to all the socialist and communist revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries. But it went nowhere. The plot was uncovered, and the three Antonios were arrested on January 1, 1781. The two French Antonios were sent back to Spain for prosecution, but died en route. Meanwhile, José Antonio de Rojas spent some time in a Spanish prison before returning home to Santiago, just in time to play a critical role in the first dissolution of Crown authority there in 1810. ",
            "Now, just as the conspiracy of the three Antonios was uncovered, the mother of all the precursor rebellions, and certainly the most famous, broke out up in Peru. This was the rebellion that was led by Túpac Amaru II. So Túpac Amaru II was originally just a prominent mestizo landowner living in a town southeast of Cusco named José Gabriel Condorcanqui. Now, by trade, he was a muleteer, that is, he ran a herd of, like, 350 mules. And though he was mixed race, he was also one of the leaders tapped to ensure that the Amerindians paid their tribute and provided their labor, so he was a very prominent Amerindian leader. ",
            "By the late 1770s, though, he had become fairly well disgusted by the exploitative system he was administering, and he started telling people that his lineage, in fact, traced back to the last Inca emperor, Túpac Amaru, who held on to a final round of the Inca Empire until he was defeated and executed in 1572. So now, self styling himself as Túpac Amaru II, we start hearing about prophecies that maybe the Spanish aren’t actually long for this world. ",
            "In November 1780, with the exploitive system getting even more exploitive, the self-proclaimed Túpac Amaru II had finally had enough. He and a core group of followers seized the local Spanish administrator, who was particularly cruel, and held him captive for just under a week, during which time they extracted from him money, guns, and ammunition, and then they forced him to call for a mass meeting of the local population. When everyone showed up, Túpac Amaru hanged the administrator and claimed that he was doing so on orders from the King of Spain. And not only that, but he also had further orders to abolish taxes and end the forced labor system. The assembled masses were thrilled, and Túpac Amaru II now had a couple of hundred followers. He also had money, and he had guns, and he put them all to good use.",
            "Now, word of this rebellion spread fast and the majority Amerindian population of Peru had suffered for so long, all rose up against the Spanish authorities. And by December 1780, Túpac Amaru was leading an army 40,000 strong to the gates of Cusco. This was a huge rebellion. ",
            "But any attempt to take Cusco itself was repulsed by the Spanish defenders. And so, much like the slave revolt in Saint Domingue a few years later, the rebels wound up holding the rural areas while the Spanish remained safely ensconced in their urban strongholds. From these strongholds, the Spanish then started orchestrating repacification expeditions. But they did have to wait until regular army troops could be moved into the area, because, as it turned out, those militias that the Bourbons had been trying to foster as the principal defenders of Spanish America, well, they were not particularly interested in fighting these Indian rebels and in many cases just went ahead and switched sides. But when the regular army arrived, repacification commenced and basically any Amerindian was considered a combatant to be dealt with accordingly, whether they were a combatant or not. And over the course of the rebellion, tens of thousands would be killed. ",
            "With its tenuous cohesion now under serious assault, the rebellion was dealt a debilitating blow in the spring of 1781, when Túpac Amaru himself was captured. He was dragged into Cusco along with his family and then forced to watch as the Spanish tortured and executed his wife and children one by one before they turned on Túpac Amaru himself. They cut his tongue out and then attempted to quarter him by having four horses pull in four different directions. But that attempt failed, and so finally, they just beheaded him. ",
            "But independent rebel groups did carry on the fight. Túpac Amaru’s brother had managed to lead a rebel army to the city of La Paz in Upper Peru and he proceeded to surround the city with a huge army and lay siege to it for the next six months. But then he, too, was captured and executed in November 1781. Now, by that point, most of Peru had been repacified, but scattered rebel groups did manage to hold on until the last of them were finally snuffed out in 1783. ",
            "Now, the Spanish, not being totally blind to what had just been unleashed, did reinstate the forced labor system and the taxes. But they legislated some corrective reforms to curb the worst abuses. They also opened up a special audienca in Cusco to hear Indian complaints against Spanish transgressors. ",
            "So then, in that same spring of 1781, right around the time that Túpac Amaru is being captured, yet another rebellion broke out up in New Granada. So in the six months between, like, November 1780 and April 1781, you’ve got three totally unrelated yet very, very troubling uprisings hitting all at once. So the latest revolt up in New Granada wound up looking a lot like a wider spread version of Quito’s rebellion of the barrios 15 years earlier. To generate more state revenue to underwrite their operations against the British, the Spanish authorities tried to squeeze greater profits from their liquor and tobacco monopolies, they pursued the sales tax with renewed vigor once again, and then introduced completely new taxes that no one had ever had to pay before. The enraged locals in New Granada were soon literally up in arms about all this, kicking off what would soon be dubbed the Revolt of the Comuneros. ",
            "Now, if you know a bit about Spanish history, you know that technically, this is the third revolt of the Comuneros in Spanish history. The first was an uprising in Castile in 1520 against the rule of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The second was a revolt down in what is now Paraguay, back in the 1720s and 1730s. All three of these were unrelated, but they did follow a pattern where local towns claimed that the tyranny of the central political leaders had triggered a justifiable devolution of sovereignty to the local towns, otherwise known as the Comunidades, the communes, the communities. Hence, the Revolt of the Comuneros. ",
            "So this latest Revolt of the Comuneros erupted in the city of Socorro, a city northeast of Bogotá, where the authorities had introduced the new taxes and monopoly edicts. And again, as had happened in Quito, the upper and lower classes joined forces to protest the intrusive new regime. They dumped out government booze and burned government tobacco, amongst other displays of open hostility. Then they took things one step further: they organized. The residents of Socorro, appointed a five man executive committee to coordinate further action. A pattern then spread across the region, with other towns forming their own communes, knitting together a loose network of rebellion with Socorro at the center. But the criollo elite were nervous about where all this might be headed. And so the five men leading the Revolt of the Comuneros in Socorro actually all signed a letter to the viceroy saying that they had accepted their roles under duress and that their principal concern was making sure that things didn’t get out of hand. So the comuneros then stopped destroying tobacco and booze and instead sold it to raise money to fund their little rebellion. And the next thing you know, you’ve got somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 to 20,000 armed men marching on Bogotá. ",
            "With the viceroy himself down in Cartagena (thank you to everybody who told me how badly I was pronouncing it last week), the audienca in Bogota was the only authority around, and they had no troops to defend them because all the troops were down in Cartagena, too. And the audienca might have called out the militia, but a bunch of the militiamen were already on the other side. And so calling the rest in might just double the strength of the rebellion. When the comunera army approached Bogotá, they proceeded then to negotiate. And the terms were simple: in exchange for us not sacking Bogotá, the audienca will repeal all the new monopoly rules and taxe, and then hinting again at that underlying criollo-peninsular tension. In the future, criollo applicants for various state jobs would be given preferential treatment over peninsulares. ",
            "Now, the audienca agreed to all this because they were staring down a huge army. But the viceroy in Cartagena heard the terms and he hit the roof. He ordered regular army troops to march on Bogotá, restore order, and cancel any and all capitulations. Once the army arrived, the comuneros folded, at least the leadership did. The elite criollos appeared ready to shut the whole thing down as things got hairy, and the arrival of the regular army was their cue to split. And their reticence to keep pushing, like has happened in Quito, might be traced back to their fear that resisting political and economic reforms might lead to an uncontrollable social revolution that would engulf them, the criollo, along with the hated Spanish peninsulares. And this was not an abstract fear now, because word had by now reached Bogotá that a massive Indian rebellion was underway in Peru and might be spreading north. So the lower class comunera rebels were told to either drop the business right now or face the Spanish army without any elite backing. Most abandoned the cause, but a few fought on, only to be snuffed out by the end of 1781. ",
            "So, as with the rebellion to the 1760s, this run of rebellion in the early 1780s did not lead directly to a movement for independence. And in fact, we are still one full generation away before we get there. But this does bring us perfectly to the point of departure for the man who would become known as the precursor, the man who would dedicate his life to the project of Spanish American independence, to the point where he practically became synonymous with the project for Spanish American independence. That’s Francisco de Miranda. And we will spend the rest of today’s episodes on the adventures of Francisco de Miranda, which, if you’ve never heard of him, is going to be pretty fun because he just sort of wanders his way through the American, French and even, very briefly, Haitian revolution. ",
            "So, Francisco de Miranda was born in Caracas in 1750. His mother came from a wealthy criollo family, while his father was an émigré from the Spanish Canary Islands. Miranda’s father rose up to become a prominent merchant, but his Canary Island roots led the Caracas elite to turn their noses up at him. And though the elder Miranda secured a prestigious captaincy in the local militia, two jealous rivals accused him of having African blood, which in the caste system would have disbarred him from the post. The elder Miranda now had the support of the governor of Caracas, but he had to go to great lengths to prove that his bloodline was, in fact, pure, and even then would voluntarily resign over the issue in 1769. It was a humiliation that burned the father and roused the indignation of the son. ",
            "A young Francisco and his siblings, though, did receive a topflight Jesuit education, and the boy turned out to be a voracious reader and an incurable bibliophile. He loved books. He’s going to love books his whole life. And as the flood of Enlightenment material poured out of Europe, young Francisco gobbled up whatever he could. You name it, he read it. ",
            "He graduated from a small university in Caracas before making ready to continue his education in Spain. And so, in 1771, at the age of 21, Francisco de Miranda departed Caracas. And though no one could have imagined it at the time, he would not, in fact, again set foot on Venezuelan soil for 35 years. He spent the next two years as a student in Madrid, and upon completing his studies, he purchased a captaincy in a regiment of the Spanish Regular Army in 1773. At the time, Spain was trying to hold on to its last remaining possessions in North Africa, and Miranda saw the first action of his career defending the Spanish occupied city of Melilla in 1774. But Captain Miranda was not exactly an ideal soldier. He much preferred reading to the soldier’s life. Suspicious bookkeeping seemed to follow him wherever he was posted, and he was both insubordinate to superiors and overly harsh towards subordinates. But he did bounce around various posts in Spain then, until the Spanish entered the American War of Independence and Miranda’s application to take his services back to the Americas was granted. But though he returned to the Caribbean in August of 1780, he does not appear to have dropped by Caracas to, like, visit his family or anything. He was stationed in Cuba, then promoted to lieutenant colonel, and arrived just as the Spanish were on a nice little run of success against the British, taking first Baton Rouge, and then Mobile. The first operation Miranda himself appears to have participated in came in early 1781, when the Spanish laid siege to Fort Pensacola. The siege lasted for just about two months and ended with the British capitulation in May 1781 – all of this happening around Episode 2.12, just as the Americans and French were converging on Yorktown. ",
            "Shortly thereafter, Colonel Miranda was dispatched to Jamaica to arrange for the release of 900 Spanish prisoners, and while there, he, of course, came into direct contact with British officers and citizens with whom he developed a very natural rapport. Miranda greatly admired the forward thinking British, as opposed to what he considered to be the backwardness of the Spanish. And while he was there, he also arranged for the purchase of some British ships for the Spanish Navy. And then, crucially, he cut a deal with a British merchant to fill the holds with British goods to resell them in the closed Spanish markets. When he got back to Cuba, Miranda’s enemies, and he had his share, accused him of being a British spy and a smuggler. These charges would then hang over his head for almost two years. And while he managed to fend off arrest with the help of some well placed friends, because he had his fair share of those two, in the summer of 1783, he was tipped off that the governor of Cuba was going to arrest him. Rather than take his chances with the authorities, Miranda ran for it. He secretly boarded an American ship in June 1783 and sailed off to the Carolinas, beginning a life of permanent exile. ",
            "Miranda was a dreamer with a very healthy ego and a chip on his shoulder, and it is likely that he was already mulling what it might take to lead a glorious fight for freedom in his own homeland, to break away from the arrogant, petty and backward Spanish. And as he traveled the globe, he would only become more fervent in his belief that it was his destiny to free America from Spanish rule. ",
            "Miranda would then spend the next year and a half in the United States. And though when he arrived in a young country, he had only very rough English and no connections, he soon charmed his way up the coast and would leave a much loved semi celebrity. He was well-read, insatiably, curious, and a perfect guest. He was, by all accounts, a witty, fun loving guy who often complained only that the austere Protestant Americans just didn’t want to drink with him enough. And as he moved from the Carolinas to Philadelphia to New York to Boston, he collected calling cards that would open future doors for him. And it did not take long for the dashing enlightened Spaniard to crack the upper rung of the American economic and political elite, including, among others, George Washington, Thomas Payne, the Marquis de Lafayette, Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson, Henry Knox, Sam Adams, and Alexander Hamilton, forming in particular lifelong friendships with both Knox and Hamilton, with whom he would exchange letters for the next 20 years. And this is all going on through Episode 2.14 – “The Critical Period”, as all of these guys are dealing with the transition from being an independent republic under the Articles of Confederation that are not working so well, and then he’s going to leave just before the Constitutional Convention convenes. ",
            "Miranda was also a great friend of the ladies, beginning his reputation as a revolutionary Don Juan. And on a few occasions, his decision to move on stemmed from one of his frequent affairs. ",
            "Wherever he traveled, Miranda was a meticulous observer of everything he encountered: social habits, governmental systems, economics, the physical infrastructure, religion, science, nature, whatever. He took it all in and wrote it all down in a meticulously kept diary. And he was particularly interested in Revolutionary War battle sites. Then he made contact with continental veterans to take him on tours of the grounds upon which they had fought. I mean, he’s really studying what it’s going to take here. The Americans loved the serious attention that he was giving them and their cause, and he came to admire their earnest Republicanism greatly. And together they all talked about the dream of Spanish American independence. ",
            "Miranda then wrapped up his tour in Boston in late 1784, engaged in long talks with Sam Adams about the process of winning an independent republic. But then he decided to keep on moving. And in early 1785, he boarded a ship in Boston and set sail for London, leaving behind an array of friends and contacts and allies that he could and would draw upon down the road. And indeed, when he entered London he came with a stack of letters of introduction that he used to enter the small American social circle in London. And in that circle, he quickly became best friends with Colonel William Smith who was attached to the American Embassy and serving the man who was about to become his, that is Smith’s father-in-law, Ambassador John Adams. ",
            "Smith and Miranda made plans to go on a grand tour of the continent together. And in August 1785, they crossed over to the Netherlands and from there went on to Berlin where they witnessed Prussian military exercises. They then spent the next few weeks making their way down to Vienna and from there to Budapest, where they no joke got to hang out for a few days kicking it with the great composer Joseph Haydn. And I am thinking of starting a historical parlor game that’s called Six Degrees of Francisco de Miranda because seriously, he meets, talks to, has dinner with, lives with practically every notable intellectual, artistic and political figure of the age. ",
            "So Colonel Smith then had to return to London and so Miranda pressed on alone through the Alps and into Italy. And when he got there, he started making contact with the exiled American Jesuit community, most of whom had taken up residence in Italy. Now, when those guys had arrived in Europe they discovered that the Europeans were phenomenally ignorant about the Americas. And so to dispel ignorant prejudices, they had started cranking out natural histories of the Americas and social histories and various other scholarly works to defend their homeland, and explain it to the Europeans, forging, as I said last week, a uniquely pro-American identity that Miranda would come to thoroughly embrace. ",
            "Now, Miranda’s diary is suspiciously silent on which of the prominent, probably now seditious, Jesuits that he met with, but that’s not exactly the kind of thing you just go writing down. He finally settled in Rome for two months and inhaled that great city, before heading to Athens in the spring of 1786 to inhale that great city, and from there to Constantinople, where he spent a further few months inhaling that great city. Everywhere he went, he studied the history, and the language, and the culture, and wrote it all down, and he pondered it, and he thought about it, I mean, really, Francisco de Miranda is a guy who has a very unique perspective on the early modern world, because he goes everywhere, sees everything and meets everybody. ",
            "Now, at this point, he makes a fateful decision in 1787 to make his way up into Russia. And while in the Crimea, Miranda met the great general and statesman Grigori Potjomkin, or, as we call him in English, Potemkin, who took a liking to Miranda and told the Spanish exile to accompany him to Kiev to meet the Empress Catherine the Great. So in February 1787, Miranda finds himself invited to a dinner with the Empress. Catherine was as enlightened a despot as they come, and she herself was insatiably curious and so she spent the meal peppering Miranda with questions about his Spanish American homeland. Miranda was charming and insightful enough with his answers that the Empress brought him into her inner circle of favorites. And over the next few weeks and months, the two engaged in long, meandering discussions about every topic imaginable. Now, the standard rumor to emerge from all this is that they also became lovers. But there is surprisingly little evidence of a physical relationship and, in fact, much to discredit the claim. ",
            "But as was usually his MO, wherever Miranda went, as much as he could, he talked about Spanish American independence, and he was now trying to talk Catherine into backing him. Now, the Empress seemed interested in supporting the project, but soon enough, a renewed war with the Turks would draw her attention and her money much closer to home. ",
            "Now, while Miranda is doing all of this traveling, he is always traveling under an alias, because the Spanish diplomatic corps is out there sending out alerts to keep an eye out for this wandering, troublesome deserter. And it soon came to the attention of the Spanish ambassador in Russia that this charismatic Spaniard who had taken up with Catherine was indeed this troublesome deserter. And he protested to Catherine, whereupon the Empress made Miranda a Russian count and gave him 10,000 rubles to live on. Now, she implored Miranda to live in Russia permanently, but he declined, whereupon Catherine offered him the protection of the Russian embassies wherever he went in Europe, just in case the Spanish managed to convince some local government to arrest him. ",
            "So Miranda left Russia and traveled through Scandinavia before hopping down to Copenhagen and from there down the Rhine, all through the summer of 1788. And eventually he arrived in Switzerland in September 1788, where he made a point to call on the famous English historian Edward Gibbon to talk a little Roman history. From Switzerland, Miranda went over into France, and when he got to Marseilles, he was warmly welcomed by Abbé Raynal. Remember? He’s the guy who wrote that “History of the Two Indies” that called for a black Spartacus to avenge the New World. Well, Miranda had, of course, read Raynal’s book, because he read everything. And the two spent a great deal of time discussing the future of the Americas. From Marseilles, Miranda then traveled up to Paris, arriving in, you guessed it, May 1789, right smack dab at the beginning of the French Revolution. He literally arrived on May 5, the day the Estates General convened in Versailles. ",
            "But Miranda did not care much for the French. He was an Anglophile all the way, and he had no intention of getting sucked into the mad squabbles consuming Paris. At least not yet. And so, in June, just days before the Tennis Court Oath, he headed back up to London. Upon arrival in London, he was entered onto the roles of the Russian Embassy, and from that point on, he lived under their diplomatic protection. But by now, though, Miranda’s reputation had wound its way up to the highest levels of the British government. And Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder invited Miranda to a secret meeting to discuss this rumored plan of South American independence and how the British might be of assistance. Miranda then went on the British payroll and got his first chance to really start drawing up serious plans for Spanish American independence. How the liberation would work, how a new government might function. He also provided Pitt with tons of intelligence on the often impenetrable world of the Spanish Empire. And it does kind of seem like that was all Pitt was really after, because once Miranda has dumped all of this in his lap, Pitt just stopped returning his calls. And over the next two years, Miranda grew increasingly irate and depressed as he finally came to realize that Pitt was just stringing him along. ",
            "So in 1792, Miranda had pretty well given up on British assistance and he turned his attention back to revolutionary France as a better vehicle for his ambitions. And in March 1792, he got on a boat and went back to France, and he arrived in Paris just in time for the Legislative Assembly to declare war on Austria just a few weeks later, and we are now at Episode 3.22 – “War”. ",
            "Miranda then fell in with the Girondin intellectual circle, cue ominous music. And after the sudden overthrow of the monarchy on August 10, 1792, Miranda was approached by Alexandre Pétion about signing up for the armies of the French Republic, which were in dire need of experienced officers. ",
            "Now, the thing here is that the French were under the impression that Miranda had been a brigadier general during the American War of Independence, a notion that Lieutenant Colonel Miranda did not disabuse them of. He was then commissioned as a field marshal and left for the front in Belgium just days before the September Massacres – we’re now at Episode 3.24. When he arrived up in the Army of the North, he joined high command of General Dumouriez, who was at present about to go win the surprise victory at Valmy, which, unless I am mistaken, Miranda did not participate in. ",
            "So anyway, here is the craziest kicker of all. After the Austro-Prussian allied army had retreated out of France, Jacques Pierre Brissot turned his own attention back to the problem of the rebellion in Saint Domingue, because we are, right now, right around Episode 4.6 / 4.7, where Britssot’s brothers Sonthonax and Polverel have put old Governor d’Esparbès on a boat and sent him home, and he still needs to be replaced. Brissot got it into his head that Miranda was actually the perfect man for the job. Miranda even came back to Paris to talk it all through, though he expressed some mighty huge reservations about taking on, you know, a French colony in the Caribbean currently in the throes of a massive slave rebellion. So the idea eventually does get dropped, and instead, as we saw in Episode 4.7, they sent our ill-fated little friend, Governor Galbaud. But yeah, Francisco de Miranda was almost made Governor of Saint Domingue in November 1792. ",
            "But instead, he went back up and rejoined the Army of the North. But, of course, a renewed Austrian offensive in February 1793 sent the French forces, some of them under Miranda’s command, into scattered retreat. And then Dumouriez made his ill-advised attack at Neerwinden on March 18. We are now at Episode 3.27 – “Advance and Retreat”, this obviously being the retreat part. So the French were badly beaten at Neerwinden, and when the dust settled, Dumouriez decided to fix all the blame on this possibly treasonous foreigner: his Spanish Field Marshal Miranda. Dumouriez denounced Miranda’s conduct during the battle and blamed him for the defeat. But then, of course, Dumouriez goes rogue and tries to turn his army on Paris. And when that didn’t work out, he defected to the enemy. Now, Miranda had scoffed at joining Dumouriez’s coup, but he was now in a very tight spot. His principal political connections in Paris were all Girondin, and like it or not, he was a part of Dumouriez’s senior staff, which put him under suspicion on two fronts, to say nothing of the fact that he was a foreigner. And just now, the dread foreign plot was working its way into the increasingly paranoid imaginations of the French revolutionaries. So Miranda was brought back to Paris and tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal in May 1793. But remember, this was still in the days when evidence and testimony did count for something, and Miranda wound up being cleared of all charges. ",
            "But Robespierre had mentally pinned a target on Miranda’s back. And so, after the purge of the Girondins that we talked about in Episode 3.31, and then the reorganization of the Committee of Public Safety that we talked about in Episode 3.32, that’s when they booted out Danton and brought in Robespierre, Miranda was rearrested and dumped in prison in July 1793. ",
            "But after being put in prison, his number never came up, which is honestly pretty crazy. All of his friends in the Girondin movement were fed to the guillotine in October, that was Episode 3.34. And then a bunch of the foreign plotters were wiped out when Robespierre got going on his liquidation spree in March and April 1794, that all took place in Episode 3.36. But Miranda just sat and sat and sat, and was never actually called to stand trial. And so he continued to just sit there until Thermidor arrived in July 1794. But even after Thermidor, he continued to just sit all the way until January 1795, so he sat in a French prison for, like, a year and a half, and he only did wind up getting out thanks to the maneuvering of the American ambassador, James Monroe, because Miranda still had a lot of friends in the American government. And this is also, by the by, right around the same time, Monroe is getting Thomas Paine out of a French prison, too. ",
            "Upon his release, Miranda remained in prison, but he continued to be like a generally suspicious character to the French revolutionaries. And so when the Vendémiaire uprising hit in October 1795, that was when young Bonaparte’s “whiff of grapeshot” cleared out all the conservative insurrectionaries. And we’re now at Episode 3.42. Miranda, of course, had nothing to do with it, but he was arrested and interrogated, though he did wind up getting released. But then he did have to go into hiding in the countryside because another arrest warrant was issued and he remained in hiding until that order was lifted in April 1796. Miranda then kept his head down and was mostly left alone until the Coup of Floréal comes along in Episode 3.46, at which point he was again targeted for arrest and deportation as a suspicious, reactionary foreigner. ",
            "But by then, events back in Spanish America had taken a further revolutionary turn, particularly in his native Venezuela. And Miranda suddenly had some hope that the project of Spanish American independence would yet live. And that he might be able to go back to the British and get their support, because Spain by now has capitulated to the French, and are now at war with Britain. "

        "paragraphs": [
            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So last time, we ran through the first two waves of rebellion that hit Spanish America in the years after the Seven Years War, before wandering off into the endlessly fascinating life and times of Francisco de Miranda. Now, we left Miranda in Paris, getting ready to head back up to London to reignite his dream of Spanish American independence. But we are going to leave him there for the moment while we hop back in time a little bit. Specifically, we’re hopping back to the summer of 1783, just after Miranda had deserted from the Spanish Army. ",
            "As I mentioned, it is very likely that as the then 33-year-old Miranda sailed from Cuba to the United States, that he was already dreaming of going down in history as the man who liberated Spanish South America. Well, we know that Miranda does not go down as ‘The Liberator’. He is just the precursor. But as historical coincidence would have it, as Miranda departed for his life as a wandering revolutionary, the man who would become ‘The Liberator’ was on the verge of being born back in Miranda’s hometown of Caracas. And it is time to call that man to the center of the stage. ",
            "Simón Bolívar was born on July 24, 1783, into one of Caracas’s most elite criollo families. As I mentioned two episodes back, the original patriarch of the family, Simón de Bolívar, emigrated down to Caracas in 1589, beginning a run of seven generations of the Bolívars occupying the very upper rungs of Caracas society. They owned multiple haciendas all around Venezuela that produce sugar and indigo and tropical fruits. They owned cattle ranches out in the grasslands, copper mines up in the hills. They owned a rum distillery and a textile business, and multiple townhouses in the heart of Caracas itself. And, of course, to do all the work, they owned hundreds of slaves. And generation in, and generation out, Bolívars served as senior officers in the militia and trusted civilian officials who helped administer the province of Venezuela. ",
            "And the lineage and status of Bolivar’s mother was no less august. The roots of her family sank even deeper into Venezuela than the Bolívars. She could trace her roots all the way back to a minor German noble who had emigrated to Venezuela way back in the 1530s, when the Welser banking house still ran things. So Bolívar and his siblings, two sisters and a brother, were born into the innerist inner circle of the criollo aristocracy of Venezuela, and they were the princes and princesses of Caracas. ",
            "But they were also born into an aristocracy that was entering a bit of an identity crisis. Caracas itself had not been hit with any overt insurrections yet, but that did not mean the local criollos were not chafing under increased imperial oversight and taxation. An intendant had shown up in 1776 and then a captain general in 1777, and both of these imperial offices brought with them a host of peninsulare agents, and administrators, and bureaucrats, who now seem to be sticking their noses into everything, and generally treating the criollo elite as if they were children rather than men worthy of honor and respect. ",
            "Years later, Miranda would produce a letter that he allegedly received in 1782, that is, just before he departed for exile, that had been signed by Bolívar’s father and two others complaining about the tyranny of these imperial agents and asking advice on what they could do about it – Miranda’s reputation as a dissident officer having filtered back down to Caracas. ",
            "Now, the authenticity of this letter is disputed, and it is entirely likely that it was forged by Miranda years later, which would not have been out of character, but it also wouldn’t have been out of character for the native elite of Caracas to be complaining about the intrusive Spanish authorities. ",
            "Simón’s parents did not have much influence on him growing up. His father died when he was just two, and then his mother died when he was nine, and he was raised principally by a black slave nurse named Hipólita. Bolívar’s father had stipulated in his will that the extensive family estates were to be divided between his four children. And then on top of that, an older cousin, who was a wealthy priest, died in 1785 and unexpectedly left everything to baby Simón on the condition that the child remained loyal to God and the King, which, spoiler alert, that is not going to happen. But the point here is that when Simón’s mother died in 1792, he became an incredibly rich orphan. ",
            "Now, as you might expect from a pampered rich kid who adults rarely said no to, Simón was headstrong, undisciplined, and refused to be told what to do, where to go or how to behave. After the death of his mother, he was placed in the custody of a maternal uncle, but the two clashed immediately. The uncle in question was himself an unsavory moocher who was interested principally in using the Bolívar property he now held in trust for his nephew to his own advantage. Simón repeatedly disappeared into the streets of Caracas with other boys of all social and ethnic classes to just do as he pleased. And then, in June of 1795, 12-year-old Simón got sick of his uncle’s exploitative neglect and ran away to his sister’s house, sparking a legal battle over who would have custody, because controlling Simón meant controlling his fortune until he came of age. ",
            "Now, a settlement finally placed the boy in the custody of a local teacher who then became Simón’s private tutor, the famous, or possibly infamous Simón Rodríguez. Rodríguez was an Enlightenment enthusiast, although his greatest love was reserved for the arch anti-Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Simón was also tutored during this period by a budding young intellectual named Andrés Bello. Bello was only two years older than Simón, but would in time go on to become a cornerstone of Spanish American culture. He was a philosopher, and a poet, and a statesman, and as we will see for ourselves a few episodes hence, an early patriotic revolutionary. ",
            "Now, the influence of these two tutors has apparently long been made a central feature of Bolívar biographies, but most modern historians downplay their role, because at this point in his life Simón was basically unteachable and was certainly more interested in blowing off his tutors to go play with his friends than actually listening to a word they said. It would not be until years later that he developed the habit of constant reading that became such a familiar sight in the camps of the patriot armies. ",
            "So as young Bolívar was growing up, the world around him was changing and New Granada in particular was about to become the focal point of a third wave of pre-independence unrest. This one, triggered by the seminal arrival of the French Revolution in 1789. France was suddenly generating and circulating a whole host of dangerous new ideas that the Spanish authorities could not stop from spreading into their American Empire. So right now I want to cover three incidents in particular that would rock New Granada as young Bolívar made the transition from spoiled brat to nauseating adolescent. ",
            "The first is the printing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man in Bogotá by one Antonio Nariño, helping launch Nariño into the pantheon of great precursors to Spanish American independence. Nariño had been born back in 1765, so he lands right in between the elder Miranda, who was born in 1750 and the younger Bolívar, who was born in 1783. The Nariños were uppercrust criollo and Antonio carried the family fortunes to even greater heights. He appears to have excelled at practically everything he put his mind to and was one of the richest men in the city. But he was also a child of the Enlightenment and more interested in intellectual pursuits than the simple business of business. Indeed, he seems to have modeled himself on the example of the world famous Ben Franklin: businessman by day, amateur scientist and philosopher by night. ",
            "Nariño amassed a huge collection of books and constructed a large library/laboratory/salon that he then decorated with portraits and busts of famous admirable thinkers, with pride of place going to a bust of Franklin and then the famous line about Franklin posted underneath it that he snatched the lightning from the sky and the scepter from tyrants. Nariño also hosted a regular intellectual gathering which functioned as a private salon and was one of the few ways that like-minded liberal criollos could share and discuss new ideas in a world where the public sphere was heavily censored. ",
            "Nariño managed to avoid trouble with the authorities, though. In part because he was personal friends with the viceroy of New Granada. But after the French Revolution hit, Nariño got himself into a whole heap of trouble. He followed news of events in France as best he could. And in 1794, he got his hands on something he was really not supposed to have his hands on: the Declaration of the Rights of man. And despite the fact that freedom of the press did not exist in the Spanish world, Nariño had purchased for himself a private printing press. And after getting a hold of the Rights of Man, he made a rather reckless decision. He translated it into Spanish and one Sunday morning ran off 100 copies. He sold one for sure and possibly gave a few more away, before realizing that maybe he should not actually be doing this. He tried to get the copies back, but by then it was too late. They were already beginning to circulate, and they would continue to circulate for years to come. The viceroy was now forced to take action, and he arrested his wayward friend, putting him on trial for printing and distributing censored material.",
            "The Bogotá audienca then sentenced Nariño to ten years exile in Africa, but the ship they put him on sailed first to Spain, where Nariño managed to sneak away and disappear into hiding. He hung around the outskirts of Madrid for a little while, trying to secure a pardon, but when that didn’t come, he kept moving and made his way over to France, where he almost certainly came into contact with the South American émigrés community in Paris that Francisco de Miranda was right in the middle of. And we’re going to deal with them momentarily. But after a brief stay in Paris, Nariño kept moving and eventually wound up in London, where, like most Spanish American expats, he was contacted by and debriefed by the British government. ",
            "But Nariño was not content with life as an exile, and so he decided to return to New Granada under an assumed name. The ultimate objective was, like Miranda’s, Spanish American independence. But after traveling around his country and making discrete observations and contacts, he determined that it was a hopeless project and instead turned himself into the viceroy, whereupon he was dumped in a Cartagena prison, where he sat off and on for the next 13 years, and where he will still be when the winds of Spanish American independence comes sweeping through. ",
            "Now while the imagination of a guy like Nariño was being fired by the example of the American Revolution on the one hand and the French Revolution on the other, there was, as we know, a third major revolution floating around out there that was also firing a few imaginations: the Haitian revolution, which was unfolding practically right next door to New Granada. Just 500 miles north or so as the crow flies. And that brings us to the second incident I want to discuss: the 1795 slave rebellion in Coro, Venezuela. ",
            "Now, the great slave uprising up in Saint Domingue complicated things for liberals in Spanish America, because it represented everything that scared the crap out of the criollo elite. Now, maybe they fancied themselves the next Ben Franklin or George Washington and read approvingly from Montesquieu and Rousseau and Voltaire. But the thought of mass racial revolution sent shivers down their big white spines. At the end of the 18th century, the population of Venezuela was about 800,000, and of those, maybe 4,000 were pure white elite, and that combines the peninsulares and the criollos. Everyone else was some combination of white, black and Indian. And so that tiny white elite was very conscious that they were surrounded by, and could be overwhelmed by the “inferior races” at any moment. ",
            "So after the great slave uprising in Saint Domingue erupted in 1791, the criollo elite of New Granada no doubt heard the tales of white landowners murdered in their beds, a whole colony on fire and mass racial upheaval. And this was all ominous enough, but then their own imperial government seemed ready to betray them. In February 1795, the Council of the Indies had concluded that continuing the rigid racial caste system in their colonies was unsustainable. The vast majority of the population and whatever talent, industry and intelligence it might contain was locked out of full political, economic and social participation. Plus, the Council of the Indies was no doubt getting frequent reports about the mess in Saint Domingue. This all out race war. I mean, they were funding the slave armies and perhaps they were trying to head off just such a race war in their own domains, though I do not know exactly what role that played in their decision making. ",
            "So the Council introduced a new law that, in effect, allowed pardos, that is, mixed race, white and African, to purchase legal whiteness. So if you were a mixed race merchant and had done well for yourself, you could literally go buy a piece of paper that made you legally white. That is, you had access to all offices and privileges and educational opportunities that whites did. And as had happened in Saint Domingue, the home government trying to undo the racial caste system stoked further resentment and complaints among the criollo about the tyranny of the peninsulares who were now trying to enforce this. ",
            "And just a few months later, the criollos got hit by an even scarier jolt when the contagion of slave rebellion finally reached Venezuela. Because obviously, a huge chunk of the population wasn’t scared of the revolution in Saint Domingue, they were inspired by it. In particular, a mixed-race merchant named José Leonardo Chirino from the coastal city of Coro had sailed to Saint Domingue and back and seen firsthand that racial revolution was possible, having almost certainly spent his time in the South Province, which at that point was under the control of André Rigaud. ",
            "Now, the area around Coro was one of the principal sugar producing regions of Venezuela, which meant a large concentration of African slaves ready to rebel. So Chirino conspired with another mixed-race partner named José Caridad González to organize their anger and launch a slave rebellion. In early May 1795, they led hundreds of slaves in a mass uprising outside Coro that followed the pattern of the early Saint Domingue uprising. They destroyed sugar plantation infrastructure and killed any whites they could find. But unlike the uprising in Saint Domingue, the Coro rebellion was contained. After three days of unchecked rampaging, the army and militias moved in with overwhelming force. A good 300 men and women were apprehended and summarily executed. ",
            "The slave rebellion in Coro put a lot of elite criollo on notice that playing with revolutionary fire was a good way to burn down their whole world, and so it led them to retreat to more conservative ground. But it put others on notice that if they championed the cause of racial justice, that huge armies might flock to their banner. ",
            "So fast forward two more years to 1797, and along comes the third and final incident. I want to talk about: a revolutionary conspiracy to overthrow the imperial authorities of Venezuela. ",
            "Now, the root of this third incident also extends back to Europe, where big changes had been wrought by the course of the French revolutionary wars. Because, if you will recall from our episodes on both the French and Haitian revolutions, Spain joined the anti-French coalition in early 1793, but by mid-1795 had gotten trounced. And so, in the summer of 1795, just as the slave rebellion was being suppressed in Coro, the Spanish signed a humiliating treaty with France that made them de facto vassals of the French Republic, complete with an annual indemnity payment and the putting of their military resources at French disposal. ",
            "But peace with France meant war with Britain, and that meant that the British Navy now stood between Spain and her colonies. And this is hugely important. This is going to be a major disruption to the political economies of both sides of the Atlantic, because by 1797, Spanish America was now all but cut off from Spain. Increasingly isolated from the mother country, a group of radical liberals in Caracas got together and started plotting a revolution they hoped would combine the best elements of the American, French and Haitian revolutions. ",
            "And there were three principal ringleaders to this plot. The first was a dissident peninsular named Juan Bautista Picornell, who had been busted trying to get a revolution going in Madrid in early 1795, and for his trouble, had been packed off to prison in far away Venezuela. Upon arrival, though, he simply continued his revolutionary practices and through intermediaries, came into conspiratorial contact with two local radical liberals. And together they further developed the plan, those two being Manuel Gual and José María España. Together, these three plotted a revolution that would topple the existing social and political order. And when they were done, they hoped to declare American self government, unrestricted, free trade, the elimination of all the burdensome imperial taxes, and then follow all that up by establishing the equality of all races and the emancipation of all the slaves. I mean, this is heady stuff. ",
            "But in July 1797, before the project got off the ground, it was uncovered and everyone was forced to scatter into hiding or exile. Now, the conspiracy had by then implicated by either direct association or merely suspected support many liberal minded elites in Caracas. And it was a hugely destabilizing scandal, as young scions of prominent families were revealed to have been a part of the conspiracy. ",
            "Now, that brings all this back around to the now 14-year-old Simón Bolívar, because while he himself played no part in the uncovered conspiracy, this does mark the abrupt departure of his longtime tutor, Simón Rodríguez. Implicated in the plot, Rodríguez was apprehended and only released after promising to vacate Venezuela immediately. He did not even say goodbye. He next turns up in Jamaica under the name Samuel Robinson, marking the beginning of his own life as a revolutionary exile that would soon enough see him reunited with his former pupil back in Europe. ",
            "So those three incidents really helped set up the future dynamic of Spanish American independence, at least in New Granada. The introduction of dangerous French ideas like liberty and equality, especially being filtered through the lens of the slave revolution up in Saint Domingue, deradicalized many elites, making them far more loyal to the Spanish Crown than they might otherwise have been. But simultaneously, it radicalized others who were now fired up by the romance of revolution and wanted to bring the gospel of liberty to their own shores. And when Spanish American independence gets going, it starts to look a lot like a civil war between these two groups. ",
            "So, returning now to young Bolívar, it’s difficult to say exactly where he landed between these two groups. He would later say that as a child, he was fascinated with the great Greek and Roman heroes of old and dreamed of joining their ranks, and that he was also well versed in the American War of Independence and the glorious reputation of George Washington, who had achieved that very feat by becoming nothing less than the American Cincinnatus. But Bolívar was saying all this in retrospect, and at the time, probably he was a typical rich teenager who wasn’t thinking about much of anything beyond himself and his own immediate pleasures. ",
            "So despite the destabilizing winds now swirling through Caracas, Bolívar himself just kind of kept on moving through the standard developmental steps of a criollo aristocrat. He joined an elite militia company and spent a year learning a bit about the military arts, though nothing really serious. Mostly this was a prestige company. It’s not like it was a real battle force. And after a year in militia service, he then prepared to take the next standard step in his aristocratic training: an extended trip back to Spain. So in January 1799, he got on a ship and sailed for Spain to continue his education, or as would be far more accurate, actually begin his education. ",
            "After a long circuitous voyage to avoid British naval patrols, the now 16-year-old Bolívar landed in Spain and made his way to Madrid, where he took up residence with his uncle Esteban, one of his mother’s brothers. Now, the crazy thing here is that Esteban was currently living with a guy named Manuel Mallo, who, at that moment, mid-1799, had managed to become the Queen of Spain’s favorite lover. And that connection allowed young Bolívar to get an up close look at the very heart of the Spanish monarchy and he would be mighty unimpressed with what he saw. ",
            "So the enlightened King Charles III, he of all the reforms that we discussed, had died in 1788, just before all hell broke loose over in France, and he was succeeded by his son, King Charles IV. Now, Charles IV was not a bad guy, but he was also not the guy you wanted ascending to the throne just as the tidal wave that is the French Revolution is about to come roaring over the Pyrenees. He spent most of his time hunting and tinkering around in a workshop and mostly left the boring business of state to someone else. That someone else turned out to be his wife, Queen Maria Luisa. Now, unfortunately, Maria Luisa was not some brilliant leader or enlightened ruler and she was, in fact, all too willing to let her favorite courtiers run the show. And her favorite courtiers were also generally her favorite lovers. And her favorite, favorite lover was the infamous Manuel Godoy. ",
            "Godoy had come into her line of sight as just a good looking member of the royal bodyguard. But after taking up with the Queen, Godoy was promoted and promoted again to positions well beyond his experience, rank or intelligence, culminating with his elevation to Prime Minister in 1792, right on the eve of war with revolutionary France. He then “led” Spain through the war, right to total defeat, bankruptcy, and a humiliating treaty that left the kingdom severed from her colonies, whose gold and silver were really the only thing keeping the monarchy afloat. ",
            "So this was the state of the Spanish monarchy that young Bolívar witnessed firsthand when he accompanied his uncle to court, and it taught him a valuable lesson. The peninsulares were no better or wiser or richer even than his criollo brethren back in the Americas. They instead appeared to be a bunch of dumb, out of touch, petty, shortsighted buffoons, more interested in court gossip than the health, wellbeing and safety of their vast empire. And it’s safe to say that from this first visit to Spain, Simón Bolívar had nothing but contempt for native Spaniards. ",
            "And this was all possibly reinforced even further because the one guy he met in Madrid who seemed at all decent was himself a native of the Americas. And this is the Marqués de Uztáriz. Uztáriz was criollo. He’d been born and raised in Caracas and then come over to Spain. And through talent and skillful politicking had risen up into the very upper reaches of the Spanish monarchy. He was currently one of the most respected members of the Supreme Council of War. He knew the Bolívar family well and agreed to guide the further education of Simón, and the teenager moved into his house. ",
            "Now, what Marqués soon discovered, though, was that Bolívar’s previous education was a bad joke. I mean, the kids seriously could barely write a comprehensible sentence. So the Marqués pushed Simón into a super active and well supervised reeducation program. Bolívar himself appears to have genuinely liked and respected this intelligent and worldly Marqués, and instead of resisting the attempt to mold him, he embraced it. And this really is where Simón Bolívar is born, because he discovered that he actually enjoyed learning new things and contemplating interesting thoughts, and he started to actually apply himself to his studies. Given free reign to the Marqués’ library, he read voraciously. And from this point on, for the rest of his life, it was rare to find Bolívar without a book close at hand. ",
            "In early 1800, a shift in the Queen’s eye left Manuel Mallo out of favor and Bolívar’s uncle Esteban in prison, which likely turned Bolívar even harder against the fickle and petty royalty that was somehow running this great empire. But Bolívar brushed all this aside because it was right around the same time that he fell in love. And the love of his life was María Teresa del Toro. ",
            "Two years his elder, María Teresa’s family was native to Venezuela, but now lived in Spain, so she was herself a kind of reverse criollo. She was born in Spain to American parents, rather than being born in America to Spanish parents. Bolívar met her and fell for her hard. But her father was a little wary of this allegedly love struck 17-year-old and moved his daughter out of Madrid, possibly to test Bolívar’s sincerity. But he was totally sincere, and all he wanted to do now was marry María and return to Caracas to settle down to a life as a gentleman farmer. At this point, he really had no thought of becoming a revolutionary or joining the great cause that Francisco de Miranda was continuing to pursue from his base in London. And so before we head back to Venezuela with the newlyweds, we need to catch up with Miranda. ",
            "Now, it’s hard to say when Miranda personally learned of events back home (the slave rebellion in Coro in 1795 and the busted conspiracy in Caracas in 1797), but he was now at the center of a little expat community of South Americans in France, and as men passed back and forth between the Americas and Europe, he was likely well briefed on events back home. Now, for sure, he and Antonio Nariño met and interacted – meetings that would have taken place not long after Miranda had been released from jail back in 1795. But while Nariño moved on to London quickly, Miranda stayed in France despite the fact that he was under constant surveillance. Finally, though, the Coup of Floréal came along. That was the one that expelled the Conservatives and created the so-called Second Directory. Miranda’s name wound up on a list of suspicious foreigners to be deported. So in one of those you-can’t-fire-me-I-quit moments, Miranda decided to abandon revolutionary Paris for London. ",
            "But before he left, he got together with two other exiled South Americans: a Peruvian named José Godoy del Paz and a Chilean named Manuel José de Salas to draft a document that would make the objective of a free and independent Spanish America explicit. In December 1797, these three guys sat down and signed the so-called Paris Convention. In this document, they claimed for themselves the titles of official agents of Spanish America and then stated their goals, which was to secure the liberation of their homeland from Spain with the assistance of Great Britain and the United States. In exchange, those countries would receive favorable trade deals and straight up cash bonuses once independence had been won. The Paris Convention also stipulated that any military expedition to achieve this end would be headed by General Miranda in light of his unparalleled military experience. With this self proclaimed mandate in hand, Miranda then sailed back to London to once again lobby the British government to back the project. ",
            "Now, as had happened the last time he dealt with Prime Minister William Pitt, talk started out very agreeably, but after a flurry of discussion, Pitt’s attention turned back to more pressing matters in the war with France. We’re right around Episode 3.47, when the French have been making moves that look an awful lot like an invasion of Britain is imminent, though we know that Bonaparte had already convinced the Directory to let him launch the Egyptian Expedition. So, frustrated, Miranda went to work on his old friends in the United States. He sent copies of the Paris Convention to Alexander Hamilton and Henry Knox, with Hamilton in particular, expressing enthusiasm for the idea and saying, “Yeah, we should do this, but it would be even better if it was a purely American project, just cut the British out of it.” And it was during these intra-American discussions that Miranda struck up a rapport with the American ambassador to the Court of St. James, Rufus King, which resulted in King lending Miranda a box of papers that had recently come into the possession of the American Embassy. And this box turned out to be quite a treasure trove, seeing as how it was the collected papers of the now late Jesuit exile Juan Pablo Viscardo. ",
            "Now, as I mentioned very briefly at the end of Episode 5.2, Viscardo was a Peruvian Jesuit who had been exiled from Spanish America in 1767. Since then, he had been splitting his time between Italy and Great Britain, and he finally wound up in London in the late 1790s and had then died just a few weeks after Miranda’s arrival in the country. He died in February 1798. ",
            "Now, at some point in all this, Viscardo had begun work on what has become known as “The Letter to the Spanish Americans”, which Thomas Jefferson would later refer to as the Spanish American Declaration of Independence, and which Miranda was now pulling out of this box of papers. ",
            "Now, the Letter to the Spanish Americans was not some quick run of bullet points. It runs 90 pages, and if it was, I would have recorded it as a companion supplemental. Viscardo knew his stuff. He was very well educated, and he began by laying out 300 years of history in the Americas, which he said proved that not only did the Spanish Americans deserve independence, but they had already won it. That the early conquistadors had come with drive and determination, and through their labor and valor had built a new world that was theirs. This is actually like bringing in John Locke’s theory of property. Meanwhile, all the Spanish had done was leech onto this New World and tried to suck it dry. He actually refers to them as “blood suckers employed by the government”. He said that America owed Spain nothing, relied on Spain for nothing, and that all the strong Americans had to do was cut the feeble bond of lingering sentimental attachment to weak Spain, because that was really the only tie that bound them together. I mean, losing America would be disastrous for Spain, sure, but America losing Spain would only cut some dead weight and allow them to rise to ever greater heights. ",
            "Viscardo also made the point that the majority mixed race population of the Americas was not some inferior breed, as the peninsulares supposed, but they were instead stronger and better. The race of the future, rather than the race of the past. And this helped us stamp racial equality as one of the core ideological components of Spanish American independence. ",
            "Viscardo then said that the sum total of Spanish rule in the Americas could be reduced to just four words: ingratitude, injustice, slavery, and desolation. ",
            "Francisco de Miranda read all this and realized that he was holding the manifesto of his dreams in his hands. He set about translating and publishing it and just sending it around the world, and it is now considered to be one of the founding texts of Spanish American independence. ",
            "So Miranda would remain in London for the next few years, continuing to make his plans, meet with exiled dissidents and possible allies from Spanish America, and then just generally set himself up as the center of gravity for any revolutionary Spanish Americans who might come around. But because Simón Bolívar was not yet a revolutionary South American, he had no thoughts of ever making a pilgrimage up to London to meet Miranda. And right now, all he wants to do is get married and go home. ",
            "So we’ll wrap things up today by bringing Bolívar to the great turning point in his life. ",
            "Bolívar and María Teresa del Toro were married in Spain in May 1802, and shortly thereafter sailed back to Venezuela. They took up residence in one of Bolívar’s haciendas and settled into what they thought was going to be a long and happy life as landed gentry. But rather than settling into a long and happy life as landed gentry, tragedy struck immediately. As is so often the case with new European arrivals to the Caribbean, young María contracted yellow fever and she was dead just five months after their arrival. By his own admission, Bolívar was mad with grief and he swore that he would never remarry, which was a promise that he kept for the rest of his life. He never does again remarry. After lingering in Caracas for a few months, utterly despondent and unable to function, he resolved to return to Europe and just try to go anywhere and do anything to get over it. And he later said, ",
            "“Had I not become a widower, my life would have been very different. I would never have become General Bolívar nor The Liberator. When I was with my wife, my head was filled only with the most ardent love, not with political ideas. Those thoughts hadn’t yet captured my imagination. The death of my wife placed me early on the road of politics and caused me to follow the Chariot of Mars.”",
            "Still only 20 years old, Simón Bolívar made plans to return to Europe in 1803, and there he would begin grasping after the reins of the Chariot of Mars. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "When Simón Bolívar and his new wife María Teresa del Toro sailed away from Spain in the spring of 1802, the Europe they were leaving behind was just then entering the so-called Year of Peace. The decade of mass conflict that had begun when the Legislative Assembly declared war on Austria in April 1792 finally concluded when Napoleon Bonaparte’s Consulate signed the Treaty of Amiens with the British in March 1802. And no one was more relieved by the peace than the ailing Spanish monarchy. Having been all but cut off from her colonies after getting sucked over to the French side of the war back in 1795, Spain hoped to start reasserting its authority in the Americas again and revived those all important shipments of gold and silver that they needed to survive. ",
            "But by the time that a grief stricken Bolívar boarded a ship in October 1803 to return to Europe, war had already returned to Europe. The Year of Peace ended in March 1803 and the Napoleonic Wars had begun. And the Napoleonic Wars were a catastrophe for Spain, and provide the direct trigger for the breakup of her vast American Empire. ",
            "When the now 20-year-old Bolívar landed in Spain at the end of 1803, he headed first for the house of his in-laws to deliver the tragic news of their daughter’s death. But he did not linger long in Madrid. In April 1804, he left Spain completely, accompanied by an old friend from Caracas who also happened to be his late wife’s cousin, Fernando del Toro. The two young Venezuelans crossed the Pyrenees and took up lodgings in Paris, living in the thriving expat community surrounded by men and women of all nationalities. The great victories of Bonaparte had transformed Paris from the starved and bloodsoaked nightmare of the heady days of the French Revolution into a rich and vibrant capital of what was on the verge of becoming the mighty French Empire. And indeed, Bolívar and Del Toro were there to witness that transformation firsthand, because on May 18th, 1804, just a few weeks after the two Venezuelans arrived in Paris, the Tribunate voted to transform First Consul Bonaparte into Emperor Napoleon I. ",
            "Bolívar found himself simultaneously attracted to and repelled by Napoleon’s imperial ascension. Like most liberal idealists, he had come to greatly admire General Bonaparte, who was “the heroic great man” in every sense of the word, a man to be admired by a guy like Bolívar, whose fanciful ambitions were now starting to harden into a vision of his own future greatness. Everywhere Bolívar looked in France, he saw the fruits of Bonaparte’s victories and it was impossible to miss the sharp contrast between the energetic glory of Paris and the decaying pettiness of Madrid. Everywhere he looked in France, he saw rich, dynamic advancement, while everywhere he had looked in Spain, he saw paper thin facades that covered a kingdom rotting from the inside out. ",
            "But also like many liberal idealists, Bolívar was dejected by Bonaparte’s decision to drop the pretense of republicanism and embrace overt imperial despotism. Not unlike Beethoven, Bolívar was angry that Bonaparte, the enlightened republican hero, had given himself over to such tyrannical self glorification. Bolívar did not have a magnificent symphony that he could scratch out the dedication page to, but he was still in Paris when the massive celebration of Napoleon’s imperial coronation consumed the city in December 1804. Bolívar refused to join the revelry and made a point to shut up his doors and windows on the day of the coronation and try to tune out Bonaparte’s disillusioning slip into authoritarianism. And that day will forever stand as a moment of ironic foreshadowing of Bolívar’s own tragic end. ",
            "Consumed by a sense of grief and depression and disillusionment, Bolívar threw himself into a fairly debauched Parisian world of drinking, gambling and love affairs. Not paying too much attention to the future or the past, just living for the moment. During these days of endless partying, he started attending the salon of Fanny du Villars. Seven years older than Bolívar, Fanny was a well known fixture of Parisian society life and connected to the world of the imperial family. She was married to a colonel in Napoleon’s army, who would soon enough rise to become a senator in Napoleon’s imperial government. But the Colonel didn’t care much for Paris and often left his wife alone there for long stretches of time, and she and Bolívar fell into a passionate love affair. It was also during these days that Bolívar ran into his old tutor, Simón Rodríguez. Rodríguez had become an itinerant teacher since being exiled from Venezuela back in 1797 and after arriving in Paris, he and Bolívar reconnected – Bolívar now all ears for the grab bag of radical liberal doctrines Rodríguez espoused. ",
            "By early 1805 though the running party that Bolívar had been indulging in for the better part of nine months was finally running on fumes, and partly this was because Spain and Britain had finally declared war on each other in December 1804 as a part of the expanding war of the Third Coalition, and Bolívar was now cut off from his fortune back in Caracas. He lost the last of his available cash at the gambling table and was forced to borrow money from Fanny to try to salvage himself. He then made one last run through the tables winning back enough to recover what he had lost and repay Fanny, whereupon he swore off gambling forever. And like his oath to never remarry, he would never again gamble, because when Simon Bolívar swears something, he means it. ",
            "Once he had settled all his accounts, he broke things off with Fanny and decided to move on. In short order, she took up with the Empress Joséphine’s son, eventually bearing him a child that she would later strongly imply was actually Bolívar’s. ",
            "To clear his head, Bolívar, Fernando del Toro and Simón Rodríguez decided to go on a walking tour down to Italy. They took off for the peninsula in April 1805, making a point to pass by the old house of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in Switzerland on their way. And though he was trying to leave his troubles behind, Bolívar could not escape the shadow of Emperor Napoleon. The three Venezuelans arrived in Milan in May 1805, just ahead of Napoleon, who had come to town to place the famous Iron Crown of Lombardy on his head and proclaim himself King of Italy. Again, Napoleon Bonaparte was an attractively repellent figure, and Bolívar would later note that he was mighty impressed that as Emperor, Napoleon still wore the simple, plain uniform of a simple, plain soldier while inspecting his troops. In the end, he was just a soldier among soldiers.",
            "From Milan, the three companions kept moving south through Venice and Florence on their way, naturally, to the eternal city of Rome, and like anyone with any kind of love for the ancient world, Bolívar was captivated by Rome and his head was fired with visions of the great old Roman heroes. And as he later said, from the time he was a boy, he had always dreamed of joining their ranks. Well, his path to entering those ranks had now crystallized in his mind. ",
            "It’s hard to pinpoint exactly how and why he came to set himself on a path of revolutionary glory because, remember, Bolívar would also say that before his wife died, politics had not yet captured his imagination, and had she lived, he never would have become the Liberator. So what has changed? And what has changed him? ",
            "Well, it’s clear that from his two tours through Spain, that Bolívar was unimpressed with the quote unquote “mother country” and disgusted by the Spanish monarchy. The energy and vitality of the Empire lay in America. The peninsulares were nothing but deadweight bloodsuckers. Of this, Bolívar was convinced. ",
            "Added to this personal revulsion for the Spanish were the modern liberal ideas he had been devouring since first being set loose in the library of the Marqués de Uztáriz. He had by now read and absorbed Locke, and Montesquieu, and Voltaire, and Hume, and Hobbes, and Thomas Paine, and a dozen others. He read history and philosophy and political theory and military manuals. But what’s interesting is that Bolívar always did so with a practical eye. He was not drinking all this in merely to quench some thirst for abstract knowledge. And he constantly brought the ideas and theories back around to how he could use them, how they were applicable in the real world, how they might better inform his plans, make them better plans, make them smarter plans. And then you, of course, also now have the concrete examples of the American and French and even Haitian revolutions to guide his imagination and his ambitions. ",
            "So while it’s hard to say when exactly he became convinced of his destiny, it is clear that by the summer of 1805, he was on the path. And we know this because in August 1805, he and Del Toro and Rodríguez climbed the Sacred Mount outside Rome to play out one of the most famous scenes in the legendary life of Simón Bolívar. ",
            "On August 15, 1805, the three companions took a day hike to follow in the footsteps of the plebs of Rome, who had once retired to the Sacred Mount en masse in 494 B.C. refusing to return until the patricians agreed to political and social reforms. An agitated Bolívar equated these stubborn patricians with the ignoble Spanish, and he vowed right then and there on top of the Sacred Mount, to liberate his country or die trying. And as I just said, when Bolívar makes a vow, he damn well means it. He would never marry again, he would never gamble again, and from this day forth, he was unrelenting in his obsessive drive to liberate his country from Spanish rule or die trying. ",
            "The trip to Italy wound up taking just about six months to complete, and Bolívar, Del Toro and Rodríguez returned to Paris at least by November 1805, just as the dynamics of European politics were changing drastically on all fronts. Because after crowning himself with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, Napoleon had launched his grand army at the Austrians and Russians while his navy went off to try to break the growing British stranglehold on the continent. ",
            "And while the land war would end in December 1805, with Napoleon’s spectacular victory in Austerlitz, the naval war had ended in catastrophic ruin at Trafalgar back in October. And it is the fallout from Trafalgar that is of principal interest to us here because the cream of the Spanish Navy was wiped out along with their French allies, and Britain now truly controlled the high seas. This development would have major implications for the future of Spanish America and would immediately set the stage for two failed invasions of Spanish South America. One that seemed to show that the population was not at all ready for independence, the other that they most certainly were. ",
            "The first of these invasions brings us back to Francisco de Miranda, because the Leander Expedition is the great embarrassing stumble of his life – the moment when he likely first confronted the reality that he may not go down in history as the Liberator after all. ",
            "Since returning to London in 1798, Miranda had been lobbying the British government to help him open up an American front in their larger war against the French. But the British government remained standoffish to his grand plans, and then the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 seemed to firmly close any interest they might have in Miranda’s schemes. So by 1803, Miranda was reconciling himself a bit to the fact that he might be staying in London for a while, like maybe forever. While traveling up in Yorkshire, he met a woman named Sarah Andrews and brought her back to London, where they either married officially or simply lived as common law husband and wife. I’ve seen both reported. The couple then purchased a house on Grafton Street in London, and their first child, a son named Leandro, was born in October 1803. This is just as Bolívar is embarking for his voyage back to Europe. ",
            "The Grafton Street house is now justifiably famous as the hub of Spanish American revolutionary activity in the lead-up to independence, because anyone who is anyone passed through the Grafton Street house at one point or another, as Miranda settled into a life possibly dedicated to grooming the next generation to carry on the fight. ",
            "But Miranda was not done dreaming of his own glorious return to Venezuela just yet. The breakdown of the Europe peace had led Britain and France back to war and Miranda back to his lobbying efforts. But unfortunately for Miranda, Spain had not yet been dragged into things. And indeed, in 1803 and 1804, the British had some hope that the Spanish might be brought into what ultimately became the Third Coalition. ",
            "But ever hopeful, Miranda cast a wider net in his efforts to secure British backing for a move against the Spanish Americas. He lobbied adventurous souls in the British army and Navy, avarice souls in the British merchant community, and intellectual souls looking for a moral crusade they could get behind. And to work on all these fronts, Miranda became a fixture of British social life, dining, dancing and chatting his way through high society. Now mostly, he was indulged as a charming rogue, but he did manage to convert a few influential figures to his cause. ",
            "Amongst the intellectual set, for example, Miranda started working with anti-slave hero William Wilberforce. And then, even more importantly, Miranda entered into a rich and mutually beneficial collaboration with Utilitarian reformers Jeremy Bentham and James Mill. Because, of course, Miranda becomes tight with Bentham and Mill, and he, no joke, almost convinces Jeremy Bentham to move to Spanish America. But that would come later, after the fiasco that was the Leander Expedition. ",
            "Amongst the military set, Miranda made a number of friends, but none more critical than a senior naval officer named Sir Home Riggs Popham, who, as we will see, absolutely believed in the cause of Spanish American independence. If not for the Spanish Americans themselves, then for the British merchants that he envisioned moving into their now open markets. Popham worked tirelessly on the Admiralty to get them to approve a Miranda-led expedition. But for the time being, the British government did their usual thing: nods of approval with nothing ever being approved. And this is even after Britain and Spain redeclare war on each other in December 1804. Because if you’ll recall from that last episode of the French Revolution series on the Empire, the origins of Napoleon’s grand army, the one that is about to steamroll through Europe on its way to Austerlitz, originated along the English Channel coast, where Napoleon had been preparing for what appeared to be the inevitable invasion of Britain. So if you’re the British government, this is 100% not the time to be sending soldiers, sailors, and guns off on some harebrained adventure in Venezuela. ",
            "So once again, left hanging by the British, Miranda made up his mind by mid-1805 to act on the suggestion made years earlier by his friend Alexander Hamilton: to make this an exclusively American project. In September 1805, that is, just before Trafalgar, Miranda packed up his bags, left his pregnant wife and young son behind, and sailed for the United States. ",
            "Now, unfortunately, by this point, Hamilton himself was dead, shot by Aaron Burr in July 1804. But when Miranda landed in New York City, he was able to reestablish contact with other old friends. For example, his old traveling buddy, William Stephens Smith, now Controller of the Port of New York and former Ambassador in London, Rufus King. They put him in contact with a financier named Samuel Ogden and a community of merchants with experience trading in and around the Caribbean. These are the guys who would have been running guns and supplies in and out of Saint Domingue all those years. Miranda started making real, actual plans for a real, actual operation. He was done dreaming. He was done talking. He wanted to act. ",
            "In December 1805, Miranda headed down to Washington, D.C. to try to secure official approval for his operation from President Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison. ",
            "Now, they took the meeting, but as was their signature style, they were officially noncommittal, while seeming to offer private tacit support. But whatever they really said or really meant to say, when Miranda got back to New York City, he pretty much let everybody think that the White House supported his plan. And it all sure looked legit from the outside. Miranda had high placed friends everywhere and was able to purchase U.S. Government-manufactured guns and arms that he then loaded onto a ship he had rechristened the Leander, an anglified version of his son’s name, Leandro. And then adding to the general air of legitimacy, among those he first recruited was the son of his old friend William Stephens Smith, the similarly named William Steuben Smith, who was going to go along as Miranda’s personal aide-de-camp. ",
            "Then Miranda went around further recruiting, and here we get to one of the blacker marks on his record, because his recruiters were really super coy about what they were actually recruiting for. They were just promising big wages and the chance for an adventure to the down and out youth of New York City. And after the whole thing went to hell, most of these recruits claimed to have been duped by Miranda, who did not tell them they were being roped into revolutionary treason, although those claims themselves may be self-serving lies after the fact. ",
            "So in the end, Miranda recruited somewhere between 180 and 200 men for his expedition. Now, that’s not very many, but Miranda believed he only needed a small core to start with. That as soon as he landed in Venezuela and raised the banner of freedom, that his real army, an army drawn from the disaffected masses of Venezuela, would surely come running. So he loaded the Leander up with all his guns and ammunition and supplies, including a printing press, and sailed out of New York City in February 1806. ",
            "The Leander sailed down the coast and put in first at Jacmel, the port in the south province of now-independent Haiti, which is currently under the dominion of Emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Miranda and his crew spent about a month in Haiti, and while there, he started formally organizing his forces into what they really were: a vanguard military unit of what he hoped would become a grand patriot army of what he was now calling the country of Colombia. ",
            "And it was in Jamel that he first raised the flag that he had personally designed for a liberated Columbia, the familiar yellow, blue, and red that would indeed become the team colors of the patriot revolutionaries. And still today is the basis for the flags of Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. ",
            "And not to get sidetracked here, but one version of the story of how he came up with those colors is that in 1785, at the very beginning of his long tour of Europe, he was up late chatting with literary giant/statesman/natural philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, because of course Miranda stays up late chatting with Goethe, and Goethe told him that Miranda’s destiny was to, quote, “create in your land a place where primary colors are not distorted.” And according to Goethe’s theories of color, the two primary colors were yellow and blue, with red being a synthesis of the two. Now, don’t bother trying to work out the scientific logic of that or email me about what Goethe’s theories really were because this is just a story that Miranda later tells. ",
            "While in Haiti, he also put his printing press to use, running off 2,000 copies of a proclamation to the inhabitants of South America that he planned to distribute upon arrival in Venezuela, advising the population that all men aged 16 to 65 were now subject to conscription into Miranda’s patriot army, and advising everyone to pin a tricolor yellow, blue and red cockade to their hats so that they would not be mistaken for unpatriotic counterrevolutionaries. He also held a ceremony formally swearing his recruits to loyalty to the free people of South America, and swearing that they would obey his orders until Miranda discharged them. ",
            "After about a month in Haiti and some growing unrest in the crew about what in fact they were all actually doing, the Leander sailed out of Jacmel in early April 1806, now accompanied by two small transports to carry all the men. After putting in for resupply in Aruba, they had made their final approach to Venezuela. ",
            "Now at this point, it had been 35 years since Miranda had set foot on Venezuelan soil. And though his name was synonymous with Venezuela in the United States and in Europe, in Venezuela itself, they hadn’t seen the guy since he departed as a 21-year-old student way back in 1771. A lot has happened since then, and though he had kept up correspondence with a few old friends, it’s not like anybody there knew him personally anymore. I mean, he was just a name, often spat out derisively as the Defector, the man organizing treason with all of the enemies of Spain. And for all his dreams of being the great hero of independence, Miranda was about to discover that the people of Venezuela were just not in the mood for him, or what were fast being revealed as his delusions of grandeur. ",
            "The Spanish authorities, of course, had spies all over the world and they were well versed in Miranda’s movements. Even if they ultimately overestimated the size of his army. They thought he might be coming with, like, 4,000 men, not, you know, 200. So as Miranda’s three ships approached the Venezuelan coast at the end of April 1806, a squadron of the local Spanish coast guard sailed out to intercept them. With the Spanish ships approaching, Miranda ordered the captain of the Leander to turn and make a run for it. But in the process they just abandoned the slower moving transports which were quickly intercepted by the Spanish and 60 or so men were captured, all of them citizens of the United States and including young William Steuben Smith. Ten of these prisoners were hanged immediately and the rest were chucked into Spanish prisons in Cartagena, their plight becoming quite a scandal once news of all this broke back home. ",
            "The Leander then took refuge back in Aruba until August when Miranda decided to take another run at things, and this time he aimed towards the city of Coro, site of that slave rebellion of 1795, which may or may not have been on his mind. But as he approached, the Spanish once again anticipated his arrival. Priests in Coro went round to all the inhabitants of the city and said that the traitor Miranda, now a British-backed pirate, was coming with a horde of infidels to ransack the town and murder everyone they found. ",
            "But this time Miranda was able to land, and on August 3, 1806, he hoisted the tricolor patriot flag and led his men to 12 miles inland to Coro, where active recruitment and conscription would begin at once. When Miranda and his men got to Coro, they found the city deserted. The panicky men did not handle this ghost town well, and there was at least one friendly fire incident when two nervous groups scouting around open fired on each other. ",
            "But as it turned out, nobody was jumpier than Miranda himself. It had been more than a decade since he had participated in any kind of actual military operation. He was now 56 years old and had spent way more time drinking and dancing and chatting than he ever had on a battlefield. Of course, if there was one outcome he could not abide by, it would be being captured alive by the Spanish. So with Coro deserted and no one flocking to his banner, and now actively afraid that Spanish forces were converging on the city, Miranda gave the order to retreat back to the Leander. On August 13, everyone reboarded the ship and put out to sea. ",
            "Miranda’s glorious return to Venezuela after so many years had lasted a pathetic eleven days and concluded not with a bang but a whimper. Maybe everyone had been right. Maybe Spanish American independence had been a pipe dream all along. But as he sailed away, this had to have been as rotten as Miranda had ever felt in his entire life. ",
            "Unable to return to the United States, both because he would have to face angry creditors and possible arrest, Miranda took up residence in British-occupied Trinidad and would remain there for the next year. And he was wise to avoid the United States because not long after the Leander had departed, the Governor of New York accused William Stephens Smith and Samuel Ogden of treason. Specifically, that their participation in Miranda’s expedition violated the 1794 active neutrality that prohibited American citizens from engaging in hostilities against foreign powers. Smith and Ogden were indicted and stood trial in July 1806. Now, their argument was that this had all been authorized by the President and the Secretary of State, but both of them now denied it, though of course they also both refused requests to testify under oath. But a sympathetic jury was unwilling to punish the two men for their participation in the project, and they were both ultimately acquitted.",
            "The plight of the men now held in the Spanish prisons, though, continued to be something of a cause célèbre in the United States for years after the fact. William Steuben Smith managed to escape from his prison in Cartagena, but his more unfortunate colleagues were still there as late as 1809 when a petition was submitted to Congress to appropriate funds to purchase their release. But Congress took no action. Now, unfortunately, I kind of lose track of these guys after that, but it would appear that they each used whatever personal connections or channels they could to secure their own personal release one by one. But ultimately, I do not know how many got out and how many died in Cartagena.",
            "The fallout from the Leander Expedition was felt all over. In the United States, Miranda’s name was now mud. The press was convinced he was a dangerous charlatan who had led American boys to their deaths, and his various American contacts now distanced themselves from Miranda for good. And then back in Paris, Bolívar heard about the expedition as he was getting ready to sail back to Venezuela, and he was furious. He believed the old man had jumped the gun and that the pathetic operation had set the cause of independence back for years.",
            "So after lingering in Trinidad until the fall of 1807, Miranda finally boarded a boat that took him back directly to England, bypassing the United States where he was liable to be arrested. And he returned home to London, now more than ever, his real home, on New Year’s Day 1808. And that might very well have been the end of the line for Francisco de Miranda, but for the moment, history was still on his side, because just as he was returning to Europe, Napoleon invaded Spain and deposed the Spanish monarchy, which marks the beginning of Spanish American independence.",
            "But we’re going to leave that all-important trigger for next week and instead turn our attention to the second invasion of 1806 that we need to talk about. One that coincidentally enough was unfolding at the same moment as the Leander Expedition, just on the other side of the continent. And I speak now of the British invasion and occupation of the Río de la Plata. ",
            "So what on earth is the Río de la Plata? Well, for starters, it’s a really big river down in southeastern South America. But more importantly, it was the fourth and final viceroyalty created by the Spanish Crown. So remember, the viceroyalties of Peru and New Spain were created back in the mid-1500s. And then they were joined eventually by the Viceroyalty of New Granada in either 1717 or 1739, depending on how you want to date things. ",
            "Well, in 1776, right in the midst of the reforms of King Charles III, the Council of the Indies formed a fourth viceroyalty, the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata, encompassing territory now roughly conforming to the modern nations of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia, with a capital in Buenos Aires, which lay on the southern banks of the Río de la Plata estuary.",
            "Now, the territory around the Río de la Plata was amongst the last to be organized because it really was still frontier territory. It was amongst the last regions to be settled by the Spanish, and, for example, colonial Argentina didn’t have much going for it economically, except for some cattle ranches. But the Río de la Plata did have the distinction of roughly marking the border between Spanish and Portuguese South America. Buenos Aires had been permanently planted on the south side of the river in 1580, and it had stood as a lonely outpost until 1680, when the Portuguese showed up and built a fort on the north side of the river, staking a claim to the region called the Banda Oriental, or what is today Uruguay. ",
            "The two powers lived in uneasy cohabitation, with both claims to the region extremely murky. But to bolster their own case, the Spanish planted the city of Montevideo on the north side of the river in 1724. But in the main, the whole region did not gin up much interest from Spanish administrators. And so, with very little direct oversight, the Río de la Plata region turned into a hotbed of contraband smuggling. This was the best place for foreign traders to get their goods into closed Spanish markets. ",
            "So during the reign of Charles III, one of the objectives was to clamp down on this kind of smuggling. And in 1776, the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata was formed. And then the following year, Spain and Portugal signed a treaty establishing more formal boundaries between their two empires, whereby the Spanish traded claims in the Amazon basin for control of the Banda Oriental.",
            "Now, despite the addition of a viceroy, the Río de la Plata was still a minor territory in the grand scheme of things. Really, the only thing it had going for it were these cattle ranches that produced meat and hides for exports, but they now also were the funnel point for the silver coming out of the great Potosí mine in the Andean interior, though by the late 1700s, this once great mine was pretty well exhausted.",
            "Now, over the years, the British and Portuguese had always been able to do a pretty thriving trade in contraband, a trade which picked up mightily during that blackout period between 1795 and 1802 when Spain was cut off from her colonies. And during those years, a British naval officer had cruised the coast and gotten it into his head that the Río de la Plata was ripe for the plucking. That man? Sir Home Riggs Popham, future friend of Francisco de Miranda, an ardent supporter of Spanish American independence.",
            "After serving at Trafalgar, now Commodore Popham was ordered to ferry an expeditionary army down to South Africa in late 1805 to capture Cape Town from the Dutch. All of this was successfully concluded by early 1806, beginning the permanent occupation of Cape Town by the British. Once it was all wrapped up, though, Popham was told to keep an eye on the Spanish American coast in case somebody tried to use it to stage some sort of counterattack against the British in South Africa.",
            "But after surveying the complete lack of defenses around Buenos Aires, no navy or regular army forces to speak of, Popham hatched a plan. Without any explicit orders, he got the General occupying Cape Town to lend him 1,500 men to make a run at invading and occupying Buenos Aires. This expeditionary force landed outside the city on June 25, 1806, and the viceroy panicked when he heard the news, picking up his treasury and fleeing for the interior. Two days later, the British marched into the city practically without firing a shot.",
            "The flight of the viceroy hacked off many of the locals who may have been okay with trading with the British but were super not interested in being annexed into the British Empire. One of those locals was a French mercenary working for the Spanish named Santiago Liniers.",
            "Along with a few other local leaders, Liniers slipped up to Montevideo and from there organized a militia composed mostly of men from the mixed-race middle classes. Once these guys were organized, Liniers launched a counterattack against the British occupiers in Buenos Aires. Unsupported, lacking reinforcements and without clear orders about what they were doing, the British troops lost key strategic points to the locals and soon found themselves surrounded. On August 14, 1806, the day after Miranda fled Venezuela, the British commander signed an armistice with Liniers and the British troops withdrew. As soon as they were gone, the Town Council of Buenos Aires voted to strip the viceroy of his military responsibilities and give them to Liniers, who they now promoted to Captain General. Liniers then set about improving the defenses of the city, drafting all able-bodied men into the militia, regardless of race and class. And then he set about fortifying the city and training them to fight. ",
            "Now, when Commodore Popham returned to London after the failure of his little invasion, the Admiralty was furious with him, and he was censured but not dismissed by a court-martial. But obviously, they were not too angry with all this because shortly thereafter, they authorized a second invasion. And by the winter of 1806, a full-blown fleet was sailing for the Río de la Plata, with 15,000 soldiers and sailors.",
            "When the British arrived, they decided this time to first attack Montevideo, landing a force in early February 1807 and capturing the city after a hard fight that saw both sides take some pretty heavy casualties. The British occupied the city for the next few months until General John Whitelocke arrived in May and took over the operation.",
            "In the aftermath of the loss of Montevideo, the audiencias of Buenos Aires took the extraordinary step of voting to depose the Viceroy and named Liniers Acting Viceroy. This new authority in hand, Liniers prepared for the British attack, which came in early July when General Whitelocke buried his forces across the river to Buenos Aires and launched an attack on the city. The militia forces led by Liniers fought hard, but the British managed to push their way into the city. But then, the militia forces just kept fighting and they refused to surrender. And after a few days, General Whitelocke decided it was hopeless. And so, on July 6, 1807, he signed an armistice with Liniers, agreeing to withdraw all British forces inside of two months. The last of the British pulled out of Montevideo in September. And when Whitelocke returned to London, he was not as lucky as Popham had been. Charged with incompetence for allowing himself to get beaten by some ragtag Spanish militias, he was court-martialed and dismissed from service.",
            "So the British invasions of the Río de la Plata had failed. But as I said, where Miranda’s expeditions convinced many that Spanish America was not ripe for independence, the inhabitants of the Río de la Plata were suddenly feeling very self-confident. The population had shown a resolute ability to defend what was theirs from a foreign invader. And what’s more, they had done it without regular Spanish army troops and frankly, without the Spanish Viceroy, who had proved himself to be cowardly and ineffective. So cowardly and ineffective, in fact, that the local town council and the audiencia had assumed the unprecedented authority to depose him from office. This growing local self-confidence and self-assertiveness would feed directly into the great May Revolution that would come along in 1810. And a lot of the guys who fought against the British in 1806 and 1807 would wind up officers in the liberating army of José de San Martín."

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "We come now to the beginning of our story. The preliminary work is done, the precursors have come and gone. The dawn of Spanish American independence is at hand, and as with the Haitian Revolution, it was a massive upheaval back in Europe that sent the revolutionary ripples across the Atlantic, wrecking the foundations of Spanish rule in the Americas. It is actually an open debate whether a grassroots independence movement would have begun had not the Spanish monarchy been overthrown by Napoleon in May 1808. But we don’t need to worry about that, because Napoleon did depose the Spanish monarchy in May 1808. And, well, here we go. ",
            "Now, at the end of 1805, the British had won the Battle of Trafalgar, and the French had won the Battle of Austerlitz. And the Battle of Austerlitz ended not just the war of the Third Coalition, but the 800-year-old Holy Roman Empire. The destruction of the Holy Roman Empire led Prussia to declare war on France in October 1806, turning the Third Coalition of Britain, Russia, and Austria into the Fourth Coalition of Britain, Russia, and Prussia. But the Fourth Coalition did not last very long at all. By the end of October, Napoleon had destroyed the Prussian army and captured Berlin. The Russians kept up a fighting retreat but were themselves thrashed at Friedland in June 1807, forcing them to sign the Treaty of Tilsit in July 1807, which, as I mentioned in that episode on the Empire, marks the apex of Napoleon’s imperial career.",
            "Now, it was as a direct result of bringing all of Central and Eastern Europe to its knees that Napoleon’s gaze turned west to the Iberian Peninsula. His anti-British continental system was only going to work if he could cordon off the entire continent. And at that moment, Portugal continued to defy the Emperor and trade with Britain. This was because the British and Portuguese have, like, the single oldest treaty of friendship in European history, dating all the way back to the late 1300s. So, as Napoleon wrapped up the Treaty of Tilsit in July 1807, he immediately demanded the Portuguese break it off with Britain, close their ports, and declare war on their oldest friend.",
            "Now, at this point, the reigning sovereign of Portugal was mad Queen Maria, who had long suffered from some sort of mental dementia. So the acting sovereign was her son, now Prince Regent John, and John’s wife was Princess Charlotte (Carlota) of Spain, the eldest daughter of King Charles IV of Spain. And yes, that will be important to know here in a minute.",
            "Now, the Portuguese royal family did not think Napoleon could possibly be serious about worrying with little old Portugal given all his other concerns. But then they got an ultimatum in August from the French ambassador that if they did not comply and close off the continent, Napoleon would depose a whole lot of them by force. ",
            "But to follow through on that threat, Napoleon had to get the French army from France to Portugal, and that meant going through Spain. Technically, Spain was still its own independent kingdom. So, to keep things nice and legal, negotiations were well underway by the fall of 1807 to secure Spanish approval for the French army to enter its territory. These negotiations, though, just so happened to be unfolding against a backdrop of family drama inside the Spanish royal family, which Napoleon decided was a golden opportunity to do a lot more than just go kick Portugal around. ",
            "So, as we discussed two episodes back, King Charles IV of Spain was an amiable dullard. His wife, Queen Maria Luisa, was a petty despot who liked to play favorites. And the guy somehow running the show was the Queen’s favorite favorite, Manuel Godoy, who had been Prime Minister now off and on for the last 15 years.",
            "Well, enter into this picture now the Crown Prince Ferdinand. Ferdinand had been born in 1784, just as Godoy was catching his mother’s eye. And the boy was raised in a very restrictive environment. Godoy apparently using his influence to stop Ferdinand from getting a proper education or access to royal funds to keep the boy from ever posing a threat to his own rule. So Ferdinand grew up hating the tyranny of Godoy and the triviality of his mother and the stupidity of his father. He also utterly lacked any sort of training, education, or experience that would prepare him to one day run Spain. Not that this would stop him from thinking that he was the man who really ought to be running Spain.",
            "So, with the latest batch of spectacular French victories in 1806 and 1807, Prince Ferdinand got it into his head that he might be able to get Napoleon’s blessing for a move against his hated parents. In October 1807, he wrote a letter to Napoleon asking for a French princess to marry and promising closer union between France and Spain when Prince Ferdinand became King Ferdinand. But his parents and Godoy discovered Ferdinand was going around behind their back, arrested the wayward prince, and rifled around in his papers, discovering that that letter had just been a part of a much wider conspiracy to overthrow Godoy.",
            "So King Charles wrote his own letter to Napoleon, saying, “Look, maybe my son isn’t going to make the greatest king, and we should arrange for one of your brothers to succeed me.” So this is all coming to Napoleon’s attention just as his agents are securing permission from Manuel Godoy for the French army to enter Spain. ",
            "On October 27, 1808, the Spanish and French signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau, which gave official approval for a French army 28,000 strong to march through Spain on their way to Portugal. The agreement then also stipulated that conquered Portugal would be partitioned into three new units, one of them an independent principality that would go to Godoy himself. And with Prince Ferdinand conspiring against him, Godoy was very interested in transforming himself from mere Prime Minister to an independent French-backed prince. So when the treaty was signed, Godoy was under the impression that he had just secured his permanent ascendancy rather than what he had really secured, which was his imminent demise.",
            "And something of Napoleon’s ultimate intentions in Iberia were already on display because the Emperor did not deign to wait for the treaty to be signed in order to send his troops across the Pyrenees. By the time the Treaty of Fontainebleau was signed, the French invasion of Iberia was already ten days underway. ",
            "The Portuguese royal family, meanwhile, had finally caught wise to the fact that Napoleon meant business, and in a flurry of activity in the fall of 1807, tried to appease him. But by then, it was too late. On November 19, 1807, the French invasion of Portugal began. Vacillating right to the very end between capitulation and making a run for it, the royal family was finally convinced by their oldest friends, the British, that back in France, Napoleon had already announced their collective abdication, so really, they needed to make a run for it. So the whole Portuguese court and thousands of nobles and officials hurriedly tossed their stuff onto whatever ships they could find, and on November 29, they set sail out of Lisbon under British protection, bound for the safety of their domains in Brazil. The next day, the French army entered Lisbon, and the seat of the Portuguese Empire would be Rio de Janeiro for the next 13 years.",
            "Now, the response to all this in Spain was mixed. A lot of people were horrified that Godoy appeared to have sold out the peninsula to the French. But others were hopeful that the arrival of Napoleon might spell the end of the decayed husk of a monarchy currently in place in Madrid and that maybe energetic French modernization efforts would revitalize Spain. But those hopes turned to dread as Napoleon ignored the limited troop number stipulated in the Treaty of Fontainebleau, saying he needed to secure the French occupation of Portugal another 100,000 troops crossed the Pyrenees between December 1807 and March 1808. And then, under various pretexts, these troops started seizing and occupying major citadels, castles, and fortresses all across northeastern Spain. And the locals caught wise quickly that the French had more on their minds than just annexing Portugal. Spanish anger at the Bourbons for having invited the French in led the court to retire from Madrid and set up shop at their winter palace in Aranjuez, which they hoped would be safer from potential mob reprisals. ",
            "But they could not escape. In mid-March, Prince Ferdinand used the general anger against Godoy, in particular, to his own advantage. On March 17, 1808, Ferdinand supporters orchestrated a mob attack on Godoy’s residence in Aranjuez. The attack came so suddenly and violently that King Charles did the only thing he could think to do to quiet them: he dismissed Godoy from service. But now the mob wanted more. They wanted Ferdinand to be king, or else. So two days later came the stunning development. On March 19, 1808, King Charles succumbed to the mob and abdicated the throne in favor of his son. Then, on March 24, Ferdinand entered Madrid to wild cheering. The kingdom had been saved from the decrepit, corrupt relics, and a new day was dawning. ",
            "And yes, a new day was indeed dawning, just not in the way anyone expected. With both the deposed Charles and the newly risen Ferdinand now both writing letters to Napoleon looking for support, Napoleon said, “Hey, I’ve got an idea. Why don’t you both come to the French city of Bayonne, and we’ll talk it all through like civilized men?”",
            "Ferdinand, convinced Napoleon was going to support his claim, arrived in Bayonne on April 20 and was promptly told that he was going to abdicate the throne immediately, or else. Ferdinand tried to resist, but then his father shot up a few days later and just caved in. On May 5, Charles relinquished his claim to the Spanish throne to Napoleon. And then, on May 6, Ferdinand caved in too. He abdicated his claim back to his father from whence it passed immediately on to Napoleon. In what is today called the Abdications of Bayonne, the Spanish Crown passed from the Bourbons to the Bonapartes. Charles IV, Queen Maria Luisa, Prince Ferdinand, and Manuel Godoy would remain prisoners of the French for the next five years. In their place, Napoleon made a major addition to the Bonaparte imperial dynasty that he was building, naming his brother Joseph King of Spain and the Indies.",
            "Napoleon thought that the Spaniards were too complacent, men lacked the moral fiber and courage to do anything but accept the abdications of Bayonne as a fait accompli. And he was basically right about the court nobles in Madrid who had no interest in being on Napoleon’s bad side. But wow, was he ever wrong about the Spaniards generally? Napoleon thought it would take a few thousand troops to garrison the country once it had been seized. But, man, was he wrong about that. A spontaneous citizen riot against the French occupiers in Madrid had already erupted on May 2. The so-called Dos de Mayo Uprising turned into a running street fight between the people of Madrid and French soldiers that was finally crushed by nightfall, whereupon the French executed anyone who had been captured with arms in their hands, kind of setting the tone for the whole rest of the conflict.",
            "The Dos de Mayo Uprising now traditionally marks the beginning of the Peninsular War, the mass Spanish resistance to Napoleon that would require him to deploy not a few thousand troops, but a few hundred thousand troops and contribute mightily to the downfall of his empire. Because it was on that day the Spanish ulcer started to bleed.",
            "Once news of the abdications of Bayonne got out, the rest of Spain went nuts. All on their own and independently of each other. The French had by now occupied a swath of territory in the north, running roughly from Pamplona down to Madrid. But in every province in Spain, local leaders started organizing resistance and declaring their intention to fight the French. And in short order, the institution that would define the early leadership of that Spanish resistance began forming – the Junta, or the Xunta, depending on your preferred pronunciation. ",
            "Operating on the principle that the metaphorical decapitation of the Spanish monarchy meant that power automatically devolved to the people. A junta was a self-selected local committee that proclaimed itself to be the representatives of the local people. By the end of May 1808, the first juntas were forming, and soon every halfway respectable municipality across Iberia had formed its own junta to act as the guardian of local sovereignty until the monarchy could be restored. And by the monarchy, everyone now meant Ferdinand. Charles IV and Godoy were blamed for letting the French in. So it was to Ferdinand that all these juntas pledged their allegiance.",
            "For the moment, these juntas were totally disconnected from each other, and none was superior or inferior to another. Although down in Seville, they rather ostentatiously declared themselves to be the Supreme Junta and made noises about trying to get the others to recognize them as the Supreme Junta. Well, that didn’t wind up happening. But the Seville Junta did become the most important of them all in these early days. Seville was a pretty wealthy little city and as far away from the French as you could get. And so, they were able to start raising a real army to fight the French army. But most importantly, for our purposes here, the Seville Junta declared jurisdiction over the Americas and took the lead in communicating with the leadership in Spanish America to make sure that they all pledged support for resistance, rather than accepting the imposter King Joseph Bonaparte.",
            "Now, it would be months before word could make its way across the Atlantic, but it took considerably less time for word to make its way up to London and into the home of Francisco de Miranda on Grafton Street, where he was once again hard at work on a new, new, new plan for a British-backed liberation of Spanish America. ",
            "As we ended last week’s episode, Miranda was just returning home to London on New Year’s Day 1808, right smack dab in the middle of the Iberian crisis. The British had just spirited away the Portuguese royal family, and French troops were continuing to flood into Spain unchecked.",
            "Now, despite the embarrassing failure of Miranda’s Leander Expedition, the British government was open to talking with him some more about the prospects in Spanish America, in part because Miranda came bearing official dispatches from the governor of Trinidad, who personally believed that the expedition had failed, not because it wouldn’t work, but because it hadn’t been nearly big enough. So the minute he returned home, Miranda got back to work with the blessing of the British government. He sat with his friend James Mill and devised a plan to transform Spanish America into four new states, each one covering one of the four viceroyalties. And then the British government assigned him to work on military logistics with Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. ",
            "Wellesley and Miranda worked up a plan to send a 10,000-man expeditionary force to Venezuela, and they were at the point where units were being transferred around as part of the mobilization, and Wellesley was putting in personal supply orders. But the whole orientation of British policy abruptly changed after the abdications of Bayonne. With reports coming in that the whole of Iberia was resisting the French invaders, the British government decided that the war against Napoleon had to be fought there, not in faraway Venezuela. The troops destined for Spanish America were redirected to an invasion of Portugal. And Wellesley was the one who had to break the news to Miranda that the expedition was going to be canceled.",
            "And Wellesley literally took Miranda out into Hyde Park to break the news, in the hopes that the gaze of potential onlookers would force Miranda to not make a scene. But Miranda did make a scene, and Wellesley later said that he “never had a more difficult business than when the government made me tell Miranda that we would have nothing to do with his plan, even there, he was so angry that I told him I would walk on first a little, that we might not attract the notice of everybody passing. And when I joined him, he was cooler. He said, ‘You are going into Spain. You will be lost. Nothing can save you. That, however, is your affair. But what grieves me is that there never was such an opportunity thrown away.’”",
            "Now, of course, Miranda was wrong about the British going into Spain. That’s not where they were lost. That’s where, in fact, they really started to win. And he was possibly even wrong that a British invasion of Venezuela would have ever succeeded. But whatever happened next, Spanish Americans were going to have to do it on their own.",
            "So, those Spanish Americans started learning about the dramatic events back in Spain in succession, depending on the time it took for news to reach them. And there could be quite a lag time, depending on where you lived.",
            "The first to find out were those in the ports of the Caribbean or the Gulf of Mexico, like Veracruz, Havana, and Caracas, who all found out about the abdications of Bayonne in mid-July 1808. The governor of Havana then sent out further emissaries in multiple directions to spread the word down to the Río de la Plata and then around to Chile and finally Lima, or over to Guatemala and Panama, and from there down to Lima, the great capital of Peru being so isolated on the Pacific side of the continent that they were, of course, the last to find out. It was not until October 4 that the Viceroy of Peru was finally told that Napoleon had deposed the monarchy and installed his brother Joseph, fully five months after the fact.",
            "But shortly after, the sensational news would hit the various cities, the Spanish Americans would then be greeted with emissaries representing the competing factions back in Europe, now trying to secure the loyalty of the Americas. The junta of Seville dispatched representatives everywhere, as did the usurping Bonapartist government. But so too did agents come round from, like, Rio de Janeiro because Princess Charlotte was now the one free member of the Spanish Bourbon royal family, and she was open to being recognized as Princess Regent in exile. So the Spanish Americans had an array of choices about how they were going to proceed. And ultimately, I’m about to walk you through the drama as it played out in New Granada, because that’s the focus of the show, but before I do that, I do want to give you the flavor of how things are unfolding in the other three viceroyalties.",
            "So, up in New Spain, the town council of Mexico City wanted the viceroy to convene some kind of representative junta. After all, New Spain was a rich and civilized kingdom of 6 million people, and Mexico City itself was truly one of the great cities in the Spanish Empire. So its people deserved the same rights as their Spanish cousins. We should have a junta, too!",
            "To the horror of conservative peninsular administrators residing in Mexico City, the viceroy himself seemed to agree. He took repeated meetings with an informal convention of local Mexico City leaders and in mid-September approached the conservative audiencia with a plan to call for the cities of New Spain to send representatives to create a consultative body for the duration of the crisis. The audiencia not only rejected this idea, but fearing that the viceroy was on his way to inviting a full-blown revolution, they orchestrated a coup. ",
            "On September 16, about 300 men stormed the viceregal palace and arrested the viceroy, along with some other prominent criollo leaders. The audiencia then installed a random 80-year-old general as the new viceroy. The movement to form a representative junta was quashed. But the new regime did agree to recognize the authority of the Seville junta and support resistance to the French. And so, this was the basic regime that would be in place when the next crisis comes along in 1810, a crisis that would help spark Father Hidalgo’s insurrection and the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence.",
            "Down in the Río de la Plata, things were complicated by a number of factors. For starters, there was the rather random complication that the acting viceroy, Santiago Liniers, was a Frenchman, so there was strong suspicion on all sides that he would quickly accept the legitimacy of King Joseph Bonaparte. But agents from both the Seville Junta and the Bonapartist government arrived in Buenos Aires in mid-August and both concluded that Liniers’ Frenchness was just not a factor. He refused to recognize the abdications of Bayonne as legitimate.",
            "Further complicating things, though, was the very close proximity of the regent to Brazil. So the Río de la Plata had the strongest faction in support of recognizing Princess Charlotte as regent. And then, of course, there were little rivalries inside the Río de la Plata that complicated things even further. So, for example, the leadership of Montevideo organized a junta of their own, but mostly it was driven by their long commercial and political rivalry with Buenos Aires. They didn’t want all of this to wind up with them becoming like vassals of Buenos Aires. And then, there were peninsulares inside Buenos Aires who never liked Liniers to begin with, and on January 1st, 1809, they tried to stage a coup to oust him. But since Liniers still had the complete loyalty of a large and well-trained militia, this coup attempt failed.",
            "So while things in the Río de la Plata were, like, chaotic, with lots of long knives being drawn, the Viceroyalty of Peru kind of went in the opposite direction. And they were by far the least affected by any kind of internal turmoil. As I said, they did not even get word of the abdications of Bayonne until October 1808. And at that point, the viceroy simply said, “Right, nothing changes. I’m still in charge, and I’ll be running things in the name of King Ferdinand until he can be restored.” The viceroy was popular with both the peninsulares and criollo elite of Lima, so when he decreed on October 13, “Look, I’m just going to be in charge until further notice,” there was no real push to challenge him. Peru was and would remain the least revolutionary of all the viceroyalties.",
            "So coming back around now to events in New Granada, we can also come back around now to Símon Bolívar and follow along in a bit more detail as he and his countrymen wrestle with the crisis caused by the abdications of Bayonne. ",
            "So we left Bolívar back in Paris at the beginning of 1806, having returned from his walking tour of Italy and his pledge to liberate his country or die trying. But estranged now from his fortune back in Venezuela, Bolívar decided it was time to return home. But with Napoleon’s armies rampaging around and the British patrolling the coasts, this was much easier said than done. So Bolívar had to borrow money and then make his way up to the neutral port of Hamburg just as Napoleon was sweeping across Germany on his way to Berlin. Bolívar then departed Hamburg on a neutral ship in November 1806, bound for the United States of America. He landed in Charleston in January 1807 after a particularly rotten voyage that saw Bolívar himself become incredibly sick along the way. But he did manage to make friends with an American from South Carolina on the ship, who brought the sick and penniless Bolívar into his home, where he could recuperate. And once he was recovered, Bolívar headed up to Philadelphia, where he was finally, finally able to make direct contact with agents in Caracas and arrange a cash draw to pay off the debts he had been accruing and secure passage home. All told, Bolívar spent about five months in the United States, where he says that he “encountered rational liberty for the first time”, though he also encountered the lingering bad taste Miranda had left in everybody’s mouth, thanks to the Leander debacle, and the prospects of his now sworn oath to liberate his country seemed to be as far away as possible. And certainly the Americans he encountered were not at all optimistic about the chances of rational liberty coming to Spanish America anytime soon. ",
            "Back in Caracas by June 1807, the now 24-year-old Bolívar took up his place as a young member of the inner circle of the Caracas aristocracy, and outwardly he spent his time managing estates and the family businesses. But on the side, Bolívar was meeting with like minded liberals of that aristocratic set mostly drawn from the younger generation like himself. Under the guise of book clubs and social parties and card games, they would meet to talk politics. Among them were his older brother, Juan Vicente, a few of his mother’s brothers, including the uncle he had so famously clashed with as a child. Also various members of the extended Del Toro family and then finally, Andrés Bello, who had once briefly been Bolívar’s tutor and who was now the principal secretary to the Captain General of Venezuela. ",
            "All through 1807 and early 1808, there wasn’t much to do but talk, though it was clear that there was an informal division between older guard criollo who feared any revolutionary action would open the doors to real Haitian style revolution, and then those, like Bolívar, who were ready to take the risk if an opportunity presented itself. ",
            "Well, of course, an opportunity then did present itself in July 1808. During his routine work as secretary to the Captain General, Andrés Bello came across two notices in an English newspaper that bore the sensational news that Napoleon had deposed the Spanish monarchy. He rushed this to the Captain General, but the Captain General dismissed him and said, “That can’t possibly be true. That’s just British propaganda.” But then, on July 15, two ships arrived at practically the same moment that confirmed the story, although they did tell two completely different versions of it.",
            "So, the first ship was flying under a French flag that turned out to be bearing official emissaries from the Bonapartist government, saying that Spain has been conquered. Joseph Bonaparte is now King of Spain, and please accept this as the new state of affairs. The second ship, however, was British, and the Captain said, “No, that is not right at all. Yes, the monarchy has been deposed, but all of Spain is in insurrection. Do not recognize the French government because none of your countrymen have.”",
            "The Captain General then vacillated over what to do. But spontaneous demonstrations broke out in Caracas against the French that became so menacing that the French envoys quietly got back on their boat in the middle of the night and sailed away. ",
            "So, with recognizing King Joseph out of the question, it now came down to: Do we form our own junta and recognize Ferdinand, or do nothing and just keep the vice regal apparatus in place untouched? I mean, what do we do? Now, the kind of liberal criollo that Bolívar hung out with agitated for a local junta that would recognize King Ferdinand. I mean, we are every bit as deserving of a junta as any other city in Spain.",
            "Now, the Captain General made a few noises that he might entertain the necessity of a junta. But then on August 3rd, a representative from the Seville Junta arrived and said, “Look, we are actually the Central Resistance Government, and we’ve decided that Venezuela ought to just stick with its existing system. We will recognize that the Captain General is the supreme authority here in Venezuela, and he will recognize that we are the supreme authority back in Spain, and then he will work with us to defeat the French.” This, of course, sounded great to the Captain General, and he slammed the door shut on calling any kind of locally representative junta, going so far as to arrest some of the leading pro-junta liberals. ",
            "But Bolívar was not among those arrested because he was really not down with their objectives because everybody was scrambling to recognize King Ferdinand. It was really all just down to how they were going to do it. Meanwhile, Bolívar was the only guy around who had ever actually met Ferdinand, and Bolívar hated Ferdinand. ",
            "Remember, back during his first trip to Spain, Bolívar had been in and around the court at Madrid, and Prince Ferdinand was just a year younger than Bolívar. The two teenagers not only met, they had, like, played tennis against each other. And Bolívar was of the opinion that Ferdinand was a spoiled brat son of a detestable royal family that he had no interest in ever bending his knee to. But Bolívar did slip out of Caracas to avoid any unpleasantness with the Captain General because he was, at this point, kind of marked as a budding radical.",
            "Meanwhile, over in New Granada proper, that is the future country of Colombia, a representative of the Seville Junta reached Cartagena on August 9 and quickly secured the loyalty of that city. But then it took that guy another month to finally make his way up the Magdalena River to Bogotá, arriving in early September. And there he bore the same basic message that had been taken to Caracas: keep the vice regal apparatus in place. Don’t bother setting up a junta. It’s really not necessary. Just keep your existing government and bureaucracy in place and please be prepared to support the great patriotic war of resistance back in Spain any way you can. The viceroy in Bogotá was all too happy with this arrangement, and he quickly nipped in the bud any attempt by the elite in Bogotá to form their own junta. ",
            "But the criollos back in Caracas were not ready to give up that easily. And after a few months, they drew up a petition signed by a bunch of local leaders saying, “We have the right to form a junta” and demanded the Captain General allow them to do so. They presented this petition on November the 24th, but the Captain General was not interested. In his mind, this was all settled. And so in response, he made a sweep of the city, arresting everyone who had signed the letter and making a big show of repression to demonstrate just how he felt about all of this junta nonsense. Bolívar, though, was not picked up in this sweep either because he had not signed the letter. He was not going to recognize Ferdinand, and in his mind, this was all the beginning of independence, and he would settle for nothing less. But it would not be until 1810 that events finally caught up to Bolívar’s vision for the future of Spanish America.",
            "So that’s where things stood at the end of 1808 in all four American viceroyalties, with the viceroys themselves continued to be the ultimate authority. All four recognizing the legitimacy of Spanish resistance to the French and the authority of the civilian junta, with attempts to create American juntas mostly suppressed.",
            "So we’ll finish up today by heading back over to Spain so that we can follow the further organization of the various independent juntas into a single central junta and its subsequent call to invite the Americans to officially participate in the government, which would help create the first real waves of independence in 1809. ",
            "So, as I mentioned, Napoleon drastically underestimated Spanish resistance and had brushed off Talleyrand’s repeated advice to please not do what you are about to do. But in his defense, Napoleon had just crushed the Austrians, the Prussians, and the Russians. I mean, what was Spain compared to the great military powers of Central and Eastern Europe?",
            "So, from the territory that the French held down to about Madrid, the French launched multiple columns out in every direction in the summer of 1808 to complete the envelopment of the Iberian Peninsula. Now, mostly, these columns found themselves harassed by independent bands of local resistance fighters. And this is famously where the term guerrilla starts to enter the military lexicon as the Spanish word for ‘little war’. But the Seville junta managed to organize detachments of the Spanish regular army and patriotic volunteers into an actual army almost 30,000 strong, that they then sent to block the advance of a 25,000-man French army into Andalusia. In mid-July 1808, that Spanish army won a resounding victory at the Battle of Bailén, forcing the complete surrender of the French. And I should mention here that among those fighting at Bailén was a Buenos Aires-born captain in the Spanish army named José de San Martín.",
            "So the shocking defeat at Bailén, plus mass resistance everywhere else, sent French plans into complete disarray. King Joseph made what was supposed to be his permanent entrance into Madrid on July 19, but he stayed in the city for not even two weeks before prudently withdrawing back to more secure territory on August 1st. The French advance in 1808 was halted and then reversed. By the end of summer, the French armies would be regrouping back behind the Ebro River.",
            "Then, to make matters worse, the British launched their invasion of Portugal in August under the command of Arthur Wellesley, future Duke of Wellington, bringing with him troops that had very recently been earmarked for the invasion of South America. And the failure of the French to secure the rest of Spain left the French army, who were holding Portugal, cut off from any resupply or reinforcement. In short order, a combined British-Portuguese army defeated the French outside Lisbon at the Battle of Vimeiro on August 21. But then the British did not press home their advantage. Wellesley had already been slated to be replaced as commander of the British forces, and when his new superiors arrived, they cut a deal with the French over Wellesley’s strenuous objections. The British actually agreed to transport the beaten 20,000-man French army out of Portugal and back to France, stipulating further that they would be allowed to take their weapons and any personal property with them. That personal property, of course, being all the Portuguese loot they could carry. These insanely lenient terms caused quite a little scandal back in London, and an investigation into the affair was convened. And while the senior British officers were officially cleared of any wrongdoing, Wellesley was the only one who was returned to active service.",
            "So by the fall of 1808, the Spanish resistance had a bit of breathing room to try to organize their government, and the various juntas agreed to try to form one executive junta representing all of them to try to coordinate national defense. On September 25, the first meeting of the so-called Central Junta convened at Aranjuez, with each provincial junta granted two seats at the table. But though the Central Junta did successfully convene, that was kind of the only thing it ever successfully did. The men participating were hopelessly at odds with each other. Some were old guard, absolute monarchist conservatives who fully intended to restore Ferdinand and the old regime. Others were new-style liberal reformers who planned to use this opportunity to establish some kind of constitutional monarchy and generally modernize Spain. So though they all had a common enemy, they were not at all pulling in the same direction, a fact soon exploited by their common enemy, the French.",
            "So the tide turned again when Napoleon decided that the situation in Spain had gotten bad enough that he needed to show his marshals how to run a war. In November 1808, the Emperor himself was in Spain, along with 100,000 reinforcements, bringing the total number of French forces in Spain up to a staggering 275,000. Napoleon then ordered a massive double envelopment of Iberia that pretty much steamrolled all organized resistance in its path. The Central Junta was soon enough in full flight to Seville, aka as far from France as they could possibly get. Napoleon himself then reentered Madrid on December 4 at the head of an 80,000 man army. ",
            "Now convening in Seville, the Central Junta did manage to make two momentous decisions. First, they signed a treaty of friendship with the British on January 15, which was of course really important for their war effort, but for our purposes was most especially important because it really reopened contact with the Americas, since the British were now facilitating rather than blocking movement across the Atlantic. And then, on January 22, the Central Junta issued a decree to their American cousins inviting them to send representatives to sit in the junta. Each viceroyalty was to send one man each, as were the major provinces of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Chile, Guatemala and the Philippines. As we will see next week, this was a decision that kept the ball rolling in Spanish America towards independence, because it acknowledged the right of the Americans to participate in the government as equals, even if they weren’t really equals with the peninsulares. But even more immediately, it was the regions not invited to participate in the junta that really kept the ball rolling towards independence. And next week, we will move through the events of 1809 and 1810. The province of Upper Peru and then the city of Quito had both been denied special representation in the junta and as a result, would declare de facto independence from all other authorities, save the deposed King Ferdinand himself in the summer of 1809. And while South America was starting to get more chaotic, the wind of the Peninsular War blew so hard against Spain that the Central Junta collapsed in early 1810, leaving yet another power vacuum that this time was fully exploited by radicals in the Americas to declare themselves independent. And in Caracas, Símon Bolívar will finally have a cause that he can get behind. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So we left off last time with Napoleon thundering into Spain, now at the head of 275,000 troops and chasing the Central Junta down to Seville. With the Emperor in Iberia, the French reversed the reverses from the year before, and even the British invasion of the peninsula that had begun so auspiciously back in August ran into major troubles. The British had advanced into Spain after kicking the French out of Portugal and were approaching Madrid in November 1808, just as Napoleon was approaching Madrid from the other direction. The British expeditionary army said, “Uh-oh!”, took a hard left and fought a running retreat to the sea, pursued by a much reenergized French army. In early January 1809, the British fought their way to the coast and were then ferried out of Spain by the Royal Navy. ",
            "So by early 1809, the north of Spain was now firmly in French hands, but the south was still free, and the Central Junta now scrambled to maintain that freedom. But the arrival of the Central Junta in Seville meant that there were now two juntas in Seville. Because though you often see them conflated, the Supreme Junta of Seville, the one that’s been organizing affairs in the Americas, is not the same thing as the Central Junta, now also of Seville. And it actually took a few weeks of bickering before the Supreme Junta of Seville agreed to recognize the ultimate authority of the Central Junta, now also of Seville. This is all very confusing, I know, but that’s history for you. ",
            "But though they were now recognized as the Supreme Patriotic Government of Spain, the Central Junta was not a well oiled machine. As I said last time, the membership was divided between conservatives and liberals and having major difficulty forging a unified plan of action, communicating with the other regional juntas or showing decisive leadership of any kind. Indeed, its leadership was insanely scattershot. They set up all the standard ministries: war, treasury, foreign affairs but absolutely could not keep ministers in office for any length of time. There was something like a dozen Ministers of War between September 1808 and January 1810, and, I mean, you just can’t have that much turnover and expect to survive. And they would not survive. British ambassadors to the junta could see how badly the resistance was being run and they started lobbying for an end to the junta system completely and in its place, appoint a very small regency council, like five or six guys max, who could actually make decisions. The British also started pushing the Spanish to call for an actual representative body to convene, like a national congress elected by the people rather than a bunch of self-declared juntas. But for the moment, the Central Junta did not listen and they forged on into the wilderness. ",
            "Now, luckily for the patriotic Spaniards, Napoleon departed the peninsula in early 1809 to deal with rumblings back east rumblings that were in fact, the direct result of patriotic Spanish resistance to the French. Because after learning that the French were getting bogged down in Iberia, the Austrians suddenly showed signs of life. Now, even though the Holy Roman Empire had been dissolved in 1806, the Austrian Empire proper was still a thing, and they had been forced to sit in the corner with a dunce cap on their heads ever since Austerlitz, while the show of mass resistance to France in Spain gave hope to the men running Austria that they might now be able to break the humiliating chains Napoleon had kept them bound with, and in April 1809, they attacked the French in Bavaria, beginning the War of the Fifth Coalition. ",
            "Now, as we’ll see here, things are not going to go great for the patriotic Spanish in 1809. They are, in fact, going to go quite badly. But had the Austrians not reopened the Eastern front, things could have gone a whole lot worse. Napoleon is now entering the whack-a-mole phase of his career where he rushes around the continent trying to beat down anti-French uprisings as they appear. Now, he’s mostly going to be successful the next few years, but then in 1812, he winds up chasing one particular mole all the way to Moscow. And, yeah, he probably should have just let that one go. ",
            "Anyway, just as the Austrians were attacking the French in April 1809, word reached the Americas that the Central Junta had invited the Americans to participate in their government. And the process to determine who the American representatives were going to be was intended to be at least kind of semi-participatory. Town councils from the principal cities, from one of the provinces designated by the Central Junta for representation, like, let’s say, Venezuela, would meet and drop a list of three potential candidates from their ranks. Then they would draw one of those names out of a hat and send the candidate’s name onto the provincial capital, in this case Caracas. There, the audiencia would meet and choose from the available candidates a further list of three names, one of whom would have his name drawn from a hat. And that guy would then be the representative of Venezuela to the Central Junta.",
            "Now, this is not democratic in any way, and the fact that the final say was going to the peninsular-dominated audiencias was telling, but still, in 1809, legitimate participation of Americans in an empire-wide government was underway. And for the rest of 1809, across Spanish America, these little kind of/sort of elections unfolded. Now, before we leave off, though, I should mention that events wound up moving too quickly for any of the representatives to actually take their place in the Central Junta. Only one guy representing New Spain, who was already in Spain when he was elected, was ever able to show up to work. ",
            "After sending along the request for American delegates, the Central Junta also started dispatching their own appointees to start taking over the reins of government in the Americas. Now, they never engaged in anything like a wholesale reappointment of all the officials, but wherever vacancies appeared, the junta took it upon itself to fill them. So down in the Río de la Plata, for example, Santiago Liniers was still only acting viceroy. So shortly after arriving in Seville, the Central Junta appointed a permanent replacement. Now, Liniers had, of course, been nothing but loyal to the patriotic resistance, but he was still French, and so you could never be too sure where his loyalties actually lay. They also appointed a new Captain General for Venezuela because though I didn’t mention this last week because I didn’t want to muddy the picture anymore than it already was, but the Captain General of Venezuela was himself, technically, only the acting Captain General. A permanent replacement was still waiting to be named when the abdications of Bayonne hit. So in January 1809, the Central Junta named a new Captain General for Venezuela, and that guy’s name was Vicente Emparán, and he would be the Captain General who gets deposed when the fun really gets going in April 1810.",
            "So the thing about Vicente Emparán is that he’s not like a tyrant or a malicious dictator. He was, point of fact, a universally well-liked, well-read, well-educated career soldier. Very much a man of the Enlightenment. He was a peninsular, but he had served as a regional governor in Venezuela from 1792 to 1804 and was known and pretty well-liked by most Venezuelans. He returned to Spain in 1804, though, just in time for Napoleon’s development of the continent. And so he was in Spain when the Peninsular War began. But the crazy thing here is that it was actually the new government of King Joseph Bonaparte that first nominated Emparán to fill the post of Captain General of Venezuela. But shortly after this appointment, Emparán crossed the lines and pledged his patriotic allegiance to King Ferdinand and the Central Junta. ",
            "But like I say, Emparán was so well-liked by everybody that when he crossed over the line, he told the Central Junta, “Oh, by the way, Joseph appointed me Captain General of Venezuela.” And the Central Junta said, “Oh, that’s actually a pretty good choice, so why don’t you just go for it?” And they ratified the decision. Emparán crossed the Atlantic shortly thereafter, arriving in Caracas in May 1809. And attached to his staff was a young inspector general, none other than Simón Bolívar’s old friend and traveling buddy, Fernando del Toro. ",
            "When Emparán arrived in Venezuela, the people of Caracas, at least the elites in Caracas, were now somewhat mollified politically by the news that they would be able to send a representative back to Spain. And so, 1809 was a year of relative peace in Venezuela. But two regions that had been denied the right to send their own representatives back to Spain were not mollified at all, and I’m thinking here of Upper Peru, aka modern Bolivia, and the city of Quito, aka the modern capital of Ecuador. Despite long standing political and economic autonomy, both interior regions were not included on the Central Junta’s list of additional provinces who deserved to be represented in the Central Junta. And so Upper Peru and Quito became the leading edge of Spanish American rebellion in the summer of 1809.",
            "So Upper Peru, remember, was first and foremost the seat of the great Potosí mine. After the conquest, the region had been a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru and governed out of Lima, but in 1776 had been transferred to the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata, in part to reorient trade in and out of the region towards an Atlantic port rather than a Pacific port. Situated up in the Andean interior, Upper Peru had never really been much directly under the thumb of either Lima or Buenos Aires, and so there was a certain sense of local independence already floating around out there. ",
            "Now, being so far removed from everybody else, it did take a while for Upper Peru to learn about the abdications of Bayonne, but when they did learn about them, the upper echelon elite were divided about how to respond, especially in the capital city of Chuquisaca, which you’ll also see referred to as Charcas, but which is today called Sucre, for reasons that will become abundantly clear down the road. ",
            "Now, not to get too deep into the weeds here, but after the news of the abdications of Bayonne arrived, the intendant and bishop of Chuquisaca were actually inclined to recognize Princess Charlotte as their sovereign, while the members of the local audiencia did not think that anybody should make any rash decisions about who to recognize since nobody had any idea what the real situation was back in Europe. But they were inclined to recognize the Seville Junta, and through them, King Ferdinand. The two camps battled back and forth about what to do until the end of May 1809. Then, on either May 25 or May 26, depending on which source you’re reading, the members of the audiencia learned that the intendant planned to arrest them all for obstructing his will, and they decided to make a preemptive strike. The audiencia ordered the arrest of the intendant and his friend the bishop, and then they formed themselves into an independent junta to run the city. This little rebellion in Chuquisaca is sometimes remembered there as the First Cry for Liberty. ",
            "This cry was then taken up six weeks later by an even more radical uprising in the great city of La Paz. Now, this time, it was the local town council that took the lead, backed by the largely mestizo population. On July 16, 1809, these guys rose up against the local intendant and bishop, deposed them from office, and formed themselves into an independent junta to run the city, just like their neighbors had over in Chuquisaca. But unlike the Chuquisaca Junta, which was largely elite peninsular or criollo, the Junta of La Paz was far more representative of the mixed-race mestizo population. They elected as their president a mixed-race military officer named Pedro Murillo, who swore loyalty and fealty to King Ferdinand, but nobody else. The La Paz Junta refused to even recognize the authority of the viceroys in Buenos Aires and Lima. And then they also started talking about racial and class reforms to forge a more egalitarian society. They issued a plan of government that said, ",
            "“Now is the time to organize a new system of government founded upon the interests of our country, which is so downtrodden by the bastard policy of Madrid. Now is the time to raise the standard of liberty in these unfortunate colonies.” ",
            "And even more than the revolution in Chuquisaca, the revolution of La Paz is the first that really captures what would become the true spirit of Spanish American independence.",
            "Meanwhile, over in New Granada, a further rebellion broke out in August 1809. As we discussed in Episode 5.3, the city of Quito was one of the earliest cities in Spanish America to get its own audiencia, and they had long enjoyed relative autonomy from the viceregal authorities, first down in Lima and then up over in Bogotá. The people of Quito considered themselves to be basically their own thing. Shortly after learning about the abdications of Bayonne, elite criollos in Quito began meeting amongst themselves to try to create an independent junta, thinking that this might be an opportunity to seize power because the tensions between the peninsulares and the criollos, tensions that had helped incite the Rebellion of the Barrios back in 1765, had never really gone away. But by the end of 1809, word was out that there would be no independent juntas in the Americas, that viceregal structure would stay in place. ",
            "But, the criollo elite kept at it to the point where there were, in fact, a rash of arrests in March 1809 over an alleged conspiracy to seize the government. So tensions continued to simmer under the surface until the summer of 1809, when word arrived that various American provinces had been invited to send a representative to the Central Junta and that Quito was not among them.  They would simply be represented by whoever was representing the wider viceroyalty of New Granada. ",
            "With this added snub sticking in their craw, a cabal of criollo got together on the night of August 9, 1809, and formed a 36-man junta to rule independently in Ferdinand’s name, bypassing any other authority. And one thing they really had going for them was the sympathy of the commander of Quito’s regular army garrison. And on August 10, that commander put his troops at the junta’s disposal, arresting peninsulares and occupying key points in the city. The junta then defended its conduct by saying that the Spaniards were, quote, “oppressors of the criollo and usurpers of their natural rights”, and that, quote, “Quito has been treated by the Spaniard to monopolize its government as a recently conquered nation. The word criollo has been used as a term of abuse and contempt”. ",
            "But unlike the La Paz revolution, the rebellion in Quito was an elite criollo affair. This was not about turning the world upside down. So while they implemented the standard big white platform: liberalized trade laws, lower taxes, abolition of all state-run monopolies, and self-government, they were not about to touch the racial caste system or, like, talk about freeing the slaves or really even invite non-criollos to participate in their new little self-government. ",
            "The new Quito Junta then declared that they were assuming jurisdiction over all the cities that had long fallen under the jurisdiction of the old audiencia of Quito. But when they sent representatives round to secure the allegiance of those cities, most of those cities refused. The critical port city of Guayaquil, for example, wanted no part of being ruled by Quito, and they were frankly appalled by the rebellion up in the, quote, unquote, capital. And here I want to make a broader point, because as we will see time and time again, there was just very little solidarity between cities adjacent to one another. In the Río de la Plata, for example, Montevideo and Buenos Aires, they were not friends. Their proximity, in fact, made them fierce rivals. And in a little bit, we’ll see Bogotá and Cartagena fighting each other to become the predominant city of patriotic New Granada. And then most of the peripheral cities in Venezuela are not going to be eager to recognize the supremacy of Caracas. And this is the great problem of federalism in the process of Spanish American independence. And in this context, it means everyone’s unwillingness to submit to the authority of anyone else. The problem of federalism will not only prove Simón Bolívar’s dream of a united South America to be a complete fantasy, but it would also fatally undermine his even more modest vision of a united Gran Colombia, because it was just a vision that nobody else really shared. ",
            "So these first cries of liberty, though, were silenced by the end of 1809. The viceroy in Lima, in particular, took stern measures against the rebellious cities of the interior. In October, 5,000 troops set out from Cusco into Upper Peru, with additional forces coming up from the Río de la Plata. The juntas in La Paz and Chuquisaca could not coordinate a defense. They were already succumbing to the disuniting forces of federalism, especially since the La Paz Junta represented a broader social revolution promoting the interest of the mestizo, while the Chuquisaca Junta was an almost exclusively white affair. After a brief fight, the rebellions of Upper Peru were crushed, and the leaders were all rounded up and mostly executed. The Viceroy of Peru then unilaterally annexed Upper Peru back under his official jurisdiction, so they’re now in the Viceroyalty of Peru again. Now, while this was all unfolding, the Viceroy of Peru also set about crushing the rebellion in Quito, sending troops up the coast, where they were reinforced by eager units from Guayaquil. Together, they marched on Quito, and in the face of armed attack, the resolve of the Quito Junta failed, and the whole thing collapsed. In October. Quito was occupied, and the old order was restored.",
            "So by New Years 1810, the first cries for liberty were fading echoes. But then, out of nowhere, those fading echoes hit a wall and came reverberating back stronger than ever, because at that same moment, a major crisis hit patriotic Spain. This crisis would upend Spanish rule in the Americas in the spring of 1810, and suddenly the cry for liberty became deafening. ",
            "So to get to that crisis, we must head back to Spain, where the now Napoleon-less French armies continued their slow envelopment of Iberia. With the British having fled the peninsula in January 1809, the French launched their second invasion of Portugal in March, and then also won their first solid victory in southern Spain when a 17,000-man French army defeated 27,000 Spaniards at the Battle of Medellín, a bloody affair that saw the French offer no quarter even to surrendering Spaniards. But the British were not just going to give up on the war, and in April they re-landed in Portugal and soon had the French on the run once again, forcing them to retreat out of Portugal for a second time in the middle of May. But then the British made it clear that they were not going to be leaving Portugal anytime soon, not even to support a Spanish offensive, because it was just too risky at that particular moment. ",
            "The Central Junta, though, spent the summer of 1809 trying to get their act together. And in the fall of 1809, they finally organized and launched their one major offensive campaign of the war, driving two armies up towards Madrid, the main army on the right, and then a little flanking army on the left. But this all culminated in November with a spectacular disaster. The main Spanish army was well over 50,000 strong, and they met a much smaller 30,000-man French army on November 19th at the Battle of Ocaña. But in that battle, the Spanish army just collapsed. They were unable to make a dent in the French lines. And then the Spanish soldiers fell into uncoordinated retreats, which turned into indiscriminate running for it. And they were just getting pounded by French guns the whole time. The Spanish lost 4,000 dead or wounded and fully 14,000 captured. And this left that flanking Spanish army just hanging out there, utterly unprotected. And soon they too were in full disorganized flight. For all intents and purposes, the Spanish army dissolved and now ceased to exist. ",
            "With no functioning armies now in the field, the Central Junta itself dissolved and ceased to exist. The French army was now able to march south into Andalusia unopposed. And in late January 1810, the members of the Central Junta recognized that Seville was indefensible, and so they decided to fall back to Cádiz, their last possible refuge. But the members of the junta all made their own individual escape from Seville, and many never bothered to show up again in Cádiz. Those who did show up convened a romp session of the Central Junta and dissolved themselves, passing power, as their British allies had long been recommending, to a small executive regency council. The people of Cádiz then rushed to shore up the defenses of the city before the French arrived. And now the walls were pretty formidable, and they did have the British Navy at their back, so this is not some hopeless last stand here. But it was still pretty ominous when the French showed up on February 4 and began digging siege lines. ",
            "So all of this is going to have a devastating effect on Spanish authority in the Americas. The nascent movements towards American autonomy that have been mostly nipped in the bud in 1808 and 1809 were premised on the viceroys and captain generals and intendants recognizing and promoting the authority of the Central Junta as the legitimate keeper of Spanish sovereignty. Well, now that body no longer exists, it’s been replaced by a tiny regency council that nobody’s ever heard of. And when word of all this hits America, it is going to reopen the debate about American autonomy. ",
            "Now, this time it would be Caracas that gets first bite at the apple and the long rumbling criollo bit off as much as they could chew. Though the local criollo of Venezuela had been partially mollified by the invitation to join the Central Junta, they still really wanted some form of self-government. And by the end of the year, they had gotten word, at least, of the establishment of the Quito Junta, though I’m not sure how much they really knew about what was going on in Upper Peru. Lines of communication in South America are long and heavily censored. But the criollo of Caracas were emboldened enough that on December 14, they were laying the groundwork for a coup against Captain General Emparán. This time, Bolívar was among the plotters. But the plot was exposed before it could be launched, and possibly at the request of Inspector General Fernando del Toro, Captain General Emparán personally took 25-year-old Simón Bolívar aside and said, “Look, you’re young, you’re reckless, but you have to knock off this kind of thing or you are going to get in a lot of trouble.” ",
            "Bolívar does not listen. ",
            "Things were mostly calm in Caracas after that until the big bomb went off on April 17, 1810. That was the day the ship arrived from Spain bearing representatives of the new regency council. They declared that they were now the supreme authority back in Spain, and that they expected Venezuela to recognize their authority, no questions asked. But Bolívar and Del Toro, both knew one of these regency council representatives from their earlier trips back through Italy, and from him learned the really real truth. The Spanish army has been blasted to smithereens. The French pretty much control all of Spain. The regency council is a couple of guys hunkered down in Cádiz, under siege. For all anybody knew at this point, the regency has fallen, and the conquest of Spain is truly complete. ",
            "For the criollo of Caracas, this was all they needed to hear. With no functioning government back in Spain to recognize, it was finally time to take matters into their own hands. So in the wee morning hours of April 19, 1810, which just so happened to be Maundy Thursday, that is, the Thursday before Easter, a group of about 100 prominent criollo leaders met and planned to force the Captain General to convene a governing junta. It is not clear, though, whether Bolívar was among them. ",
            "At dawn on April 19, these guys all marched down to City Hall, banging on doors and rousing the city to life. They then demanded that the Captain General present himself, which, by the way, they had no authority to do. But Emparán decided to come down and confront the movement head-on. He met with the criollo leaders, who demanded the immediate convening of a representative junta, and Emparán said, “Yeah, listen, we’re actually kind of in the middle of Holy Week right now, so this is not a good time. And in fact, today’s mass is coming up any minute now, so let’s break for that and we’ll come back around later.” He got up and left his office and tried to make his way down to the cathedral. But in the middle of the town square, the assembled crowd blocked his path and started chanting “To City Hall! Governor, to City Hall!” Unable to go forward, the Captain General had to go backward. ",
            "So now, back in his office, Emparán was now feeling a wee bit isolated. And then the deacon of the Caracas Cathedral showed up. And rather than backing the Captain General’s authority, he lambasted the criollos for not being more decisive about deposing him. I mean, let’s get on with the business of seizing our right to self-government. And then Emparán made one of those mistakes you hear lawyers sometimes talk about where you’re never supposed to ask a question in court you don’t already know the answer to. He did not actually think that the people hated him as much as the criollo were implying. And so he said, “We’ll see about this.” He went out to the balcony and shouted out to the people, “Do you approve of me? Do you support the new regency?” And everybody in the square thundered, “No!” So that was kind of that for Captain General Emparán. Bowing to the apparently universal sentiment that his services were no longer required, he gathered up his small staff and two days later set sail for exile in Philadelphia. Following on his heels were half the audiencia and most of the senior peninsular civil servants.",
            "The criollo of Caracas, who had been trying and failing for almost two years to form an independent junta, were finally able to do so. And they declared themselves to be the Supreme Junta of Caracas, dedicated to preserving the rights of King Ferdinand VII. They recognized no higher authority in Spain and put themselves only below Ferdinand, who at the moment was sitting under French house arrest. So this was de facto independence. ",
            "What followed then was yet another example of the problem of federalism. The Caracas Junta sent out representatives to other Venezuelan cities, inviting them to form their own juntas and recognize the supreme authority of the Caracas Junta, which some did, but others refused to do. There was a lot of intraprovincial rivalries, and so, like the cities over by Maracaibo, were just not going to put themselves under Caracas’ rule. The problem of federalism here is showing itself early, and it will continue to show itself. Plus, just as in the ill-fated Central Junta, there was disagreement within the Caracas Junta about where this was all headed. Many of the older criollo believed that they really were just holding the fort until Ferdinand could be restored. And when he did, that Venezuela would go back to being one of his domains. And most importantly, these guys wanted to make sure that this did not spill out into Haitian-style racial revolution. But there was a more radical camp, and Bolívar was one of its more radical voices. They believed that this was all headed in the direction of true independence and were willing to do what it took to make that happen. I mean, if not now, then when? ",
            "Now, at this point, Bolívar is still kind of just a kid. He’s 26 years old, with a reputation among the older criollos for being an uncompromising hothead. So he was not invited to be a member of the Caracas Junta, nor, frankly, were any of them much interested in having him around. But Bolívar was not going to be sidelined that easily, and he quickly figured out that he had something that they needed, and that was a whole bunch of money. The Bolívars were still one of the richest families in Venezuela. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So, last time we took Venezuela up to the coup of April 19, 1810, and the establishment of an independent criollo-dominated Caracas Junta. And then we wrapped up in June of 1810 with the departure of a little three-man embassy to London to try to win British support for the cause. But though Venezuela was the first to take advantage of the fall of the Central Junta in the spring of 1810, it was only the first to take advantage of it. And 1810 would prove to be a momentous year in the history of the Spanish Americas as five major rebellions took hold. But since each is as complicated as the other, I am going to invoke my goal to keep the focus here on New Granada, and instead, we’ll just briefly touch on the others.",
            "The most significant of these rebellions, at least at the moment, erupted down in the Río de la Plata, as news arrived of the fall of the Central Junta at the end of May. In a region already brimming with political and military self-confidence, a complicated little game played out, pitting everyone against everyone else. Criollo against peninsular against mestizo, liberals against conservatives, the old viceregal regime against calls for self-government. Taken together, it’s called the May Revolution and culminated in Buenos Aires on May 25, 1810, with the deposition of the viceroy and the beginning not just of the Argentinian War of Independence but also a running civil war that would engulf the region for years. The coastal cities would fight against the interior, Buenos Aires would find itself fighting against everyone else. It’s really quite a mess, and we are not going to fall into it.",
            "The third major rebellion to hit in 1810, though, we do need to talk about because it broke out over in New Granada proper, that is, modern Colombia. Word of the fall of Seville and the Central Junta reached Cartagena in May 1810. And as in Caracas and down in Buenos Aires, the local criollo elite wasted no time establishing a local governing junta to rule in Ferdinand’s name without recognizing the legitimacy of the regency, whatever that was or whatever claims to sovereignty it might be making. This pattern of junta formation then followed news up into the interior of New Granada, passing through Socorro on July 9, Socorro being the scene of the Comuneros revolt in 1781, on its way to the viceregal capital of Bogotá in July.",
            "Now, since the abdications of Bayonne, the viceroy in Bogotá had been doing a pretty okay job keeping a handle on things. Sure, he had lost Quito there in 1809, but with a timely assist from his colleague down in Peru, Quito was pacified again by the end of the year. ",
            "But as time passed, tensions grew between the criollo of Bogotá and the large population of peninsulares, who lived in the viceregal capital, because it was the viceregal capital. Now, the viceroy tried to play fair, but by disposition and, frankly, necessity, he wound up siding more and more with the peninsulares against the growing assertiveness of the criollos.",
            "Now, once word of the fall of the Central Junta arrived in Bogotá, the growing assertiveness of the criollos went into overdrive, and events moved very quickly. Leading criollos immediately demanded local autonomy and the creation of a junta. Then, in a calculated move to provoke the population, there’s this funny little incident where some of these criollo leaders asked a particularly prejudiced peninsular merchant to lend them a vase for a meeting that they were going to have, knowing full well that this guy was going to say, “No, if you want it, you have to buy it.” Then an argument broke out, and after being intentionally provoked, this peninsular merchant allegedly got so mad that he smashed the vase on the ground rather than let them take it. Now, this created an insulting incident that the criollos could then go out to use to rile up the streets, and all of it worked. With the streets now fully agitated, the viceroy agreed to convene a junta. This all took place on July 20, which is today celebrated as Colombian Independence Day, though, to be clear, there are many, many more twists and turns before they actually get there. ",
            "So the elite Bogotá criollos, then called to serve in this junta, tried to maintain some semblance of viceregal authority, at least in appearance, by making the viceroy president of the junta. But as I just said, events were now moving very quickly, and agitators out in the street protested against the prominent position now being played by the viceroy. And on July 25, the junta gave way to the streets, and the viceroy was forced to resign. Bogotá was now in the hands of local criollo leadership. But the big question remained: would their authority be limited to the city itself, or would it encompass the whole of the viceroyalty? This question would run everyone smack dab into the problem of federalism.",
            "Now, the next two rebellions don’t hit until the fall of 1810. So we’ll move now to reconnect with that little three-man Venezuelan embassy we sent across the Atlantic at the end of last week’s episode, who arrived in London just days before the Colombians deposed their viceroy. The senior Venezuelan envoy was 52-year-old Luis López Méndez, a well respected member of the criollo elite and a former mayor of Caracas. Accompanying him were 29-year-old Andrés Bello, a budding intellectual superstar and most recently, secretary to the now-deposed Captain General of Venezuela. And then, last but not least, 27-year-old Simón Bolívar, who was only on the trip because he paid for it. Their mission existed in a very gray diplomatic area, coming as they did from a self-declared rebel junta, they could not and would not be officially credentialed by the British government. But at the same time, they had made the trip across the Atlantic courtesy of the Royal Navy. Like, literally, a British naval ship came and picked them up. So it’s not like they were persona non grata. When they arrived in London, none of them knew anyone. Not one of the three had ever been to England before, and not one of the three spoke English. But that was no matter, because whenever a South American arrived in London, they would always find a warm welcome in the now-famous house on Grafton Street, home of their long-exiled countryman, Francisco de Miranda. And so to Grafton Street they went.",
            "Now, when last week left Miranda, he had just blown a gasket after being told by Arthur Wellesley, future Duke of Wellington, that their imminent plans for an invasion of South America were being scrapped in favor of throwing everything the British had into the Peninsular War. Well, Miranda is irrepressible by nature, and so, despite yet another setback, he continued to hammer away on the cause of Spanish American independence. And though he had friends in all stations of British society, Miranda’s principal collaborator at this point appears to have been the utilitarian philosopher and reformer James Mill. And just as an aside, given their long standing friendship, it is impossible for me to believe that Miranda did not meet Mill’s young son, John Stuart Mill, who was born in 1806 and from birth was basically the subject of an educational experiment to see what the human brain was actually capable of if pushed to its maximum capacity. The result was that after having a nervous breakdown, John Stuart Mill became one of the greatest philosophers and political economists in British history. And just another one degree of separation in the endlessly fascinating social web of Francisco de Miranda.",
            "Anyway, during these years, Miranda and Mill undertook to translate and publish various treaties on Spanish America, mostly written by those old exiled Jesuit intellectuals. Mill would then review the translation in one of the liberal journals floating around out there and use that review as a launching pad to espouse the cause of freedom in Spanish America. They ginned up enough enthusiasm that, as I briefly mentioned a few episodes back, Jeremy Bentham was making serious plans to move to Spanish America in 1809. Specifically, he was going to go to Mexico where he thought he might set himself up as a constitutional expert for hire if and when the walls of Spanish tyranny finally came tumbling down. But Bentham couldn’t secure the requisite visas from the Spanish Embassy and eventually moved on to other projects. ",
            "Now, in addition to his public PR campaign, Miranda also delved into a more secretive side of his independence project. Sometime in here in 1808 / 1809 / 1810, he founded an offshoot Freemasonic lodge called the Grand Reunion Lodge that he then deployed as an organizational tool to link South American patriots from across the continent into a single unified effort. As various exiles and dissidents would come through the house on Grafton Street from the Río de la Plata or Chile or New Spain or Peru, Miranda would induct them into the lodge. And the membership role of the Grand Reunion Lodge included nearly every prominent South American revolutionary. And their shared brotherhood was one of the underlying connections that allowed for whatever limited coordination took place during the wars of Independence.",
            "Now, I have not talked about the Freemasons even once here on the Revolutions podcast, which I’m sure for some of you has been a noticeable dog that has not barked. Because not only were a ton of the various revolutionaries in the American, French, and even Haitian Revolutions Masons, the theory that all of these revolutions were actually the work of the Masons has long enjoyed a certain popular prominence. ",
            "But I am personally skeptical of the idea that Freemasonry as an organization and movement were the secret drivers of these various revolutions. Yes, it was a secretive organization of enlightened liberalism, and many core Masonic beliefs became cornerstones of the Atlantic revolutionary era. But at the same time, it was also just a fairly banal social club that included educated men on the rise from all walks of life who were looking to make connections with other prominent men. These guys might be radical in their politics; they were often indifferent in their politics, and some were indeed downright reactionary in their politics. And basically, when you start digging around, Masons don’t just show up on the revolutionary side of the line, they show up on every side of the line. So it’s not nearly as straightforward as like, “Oh, a bunch of Masons staged the American Revolution, and then Washington inducted Lafayette and sent him back to plot with the Duke d’Orléans to launch the French Revolution.” And yes, all three of those guys were Masons. ",
            "So mostly I’ve kept Masonry out of the narrative because God knows we’ve had enough other stuff to talk about. But I have had some notion to do a little miniseries at some point to address all of this, the role of Masonry in the revolutions because they are linked in the popular imagination. But I haven’t yet committed to it because I can’t decide where I stand on the theory that Adam Weishaupt killed George Washington and took his place at some point after the suppression of the Bavarian Illuminati in 1785, which would explain why Washington, who just wanted to retire peacefully to Mount Vernon after the war, suddenly threw himself back into the bubbling cauldron of revolutionary politics. So I can still see both sides of the argument.",
            "Now, all of that said, the one place where you really do find all the Masons loaded over on the revolutionary side of the line is here in the wars of Spanish American independence. And it’s largely thanks to the role of Miranda’s Grand Reunion Lodge. For one thing, Masonry was outlawed in the Spanish Empire, so it’s not like there were many Masons roaming around out there to begin with. But even more importantly is the fact that the Grand Reunion Lodge was founded with an explicitly revolutionary goal. Once Miranda inducted the various exiles and dissidents, they would return home and seek out other like-minded revolutionaries and induct them into affiliated lodges. But really what’s going on here is that these guys were revolutionaries who became Masons rather than Masons who were then turned into revolutionaries.",
            "The kicker to all this here is that while Luis López Méndez and Andres Bello were both confirmed to have been inducted by Miranda into the Grand Reunion Lodge here in 1810, there’s not one shred of hard evidence that the most famous South American revolutionary of them all, Simón Bolívar, ever was. Now, I’ve seen it reported that he was. But a few years down the road, royalists would intercept a list of all the active Masons in Venezuela. Bello and Mendez’s names were on the list. Bolívar’s name was not. And then, during one of his phases of holding dictatorial power, Bolívar would issue an edict suppressing secret societies, which is not exactly something a Mason is going to do, unless it’s part of a larger conspiracy somehow.",
            "But whether he joined the Grand Reunion Lodge or not, Bolívar and Miranda were of one mind that events in Caracas must, absolutely must, be the beginning of independence. Miranda made the necessary arrangements for the three Venezuelans to meet with the British Foreign Secretary, who just so happened to be Richard Wellesley, brother of Arthur Wellesley. And I might as well mention at this point that the British ambassador to the Spanish regency was Henry Wellesley because, at this point, the Wellesley brothers are basically running the Peninsular War like a little family project, like some craft brewery they’ve started up in the basement.",
            "Now, the delicacy here is that the British had a treaty with the regency against whom these three Venezuelans were in rebellion against. So Foreign Minister Wellesley took the meeting in his private home rather than at his office to avoid conferring official legitimacy to the South Americans. The first thing Wellesley tried to do was convince them that the regency was not dead, that all was not lost in Spain, and that the British backed patriot Spain 100%. Bolívar and company, meanwhile, had come to tell the British that they would not accept the regency. This tossed-together self-declared nothing that had no legitimacy and, frankly, had no ability to tell the Venezuelans what to do. The Americans had been kept in limbo for two years by the Central Junta, and they were done taking orders from Europe.",
            "But the Caracas Junta had also given super explicit instructions to their ambassadors that independence, true independence, was not the goal. They were now and would forever remain loyal to King Ferdinand. But, of course, Bolívar is now the one doing the talking, and he just couldn’t help himself. He argued that the war-torn regency could not be expected to adequately govern the Americas and that they could expect nothing from an imprisoned king. So we’re already on our own out there. You can see where I’m going with this. ",
            "But Wellesley wouldn’t follow. The British government was allies with the regency, and he urged the Venezuelans to acknowledge the regency, though he also implied that the British would be neutral. They would not support Venezuelan independence, but they also weren’t about to spearhead a military effort to force them into allegiance.",
            "Now, an interesting wrinkle here is that the Venezuelans and British actually had the same aim. What the Caracas Junta really wanted right now was the ability to trade freely with the British. And what the British wanted was the ability to trade freely with the Venezuelans. I mean, all of Spanish America, really, but they were coming at it from two different directions. The Venezuelans wanted to do this around the regency. The British wanted to do it through the regency. And they, in fact, now planned to use the threat of Spanish American independence as leverage to force the regency to grant the British trade concessions. And indeed, for the rest of 1810, and then all through 1811, Henry Wellesley, that third Wellesley brother, would be down in Cádiz offering to mediate the conflict between Spain and her colonies in exchange for British trading rights in the Americas.",
            "The final upshot from this meeting was that the British made it clear they would neither help nor hinder the Venezuelans, while Bolívar left, having made it clear that he certainly believed this was all headed towards independence. And while Wellesley complimented Bolívar on the passion of his argument, he also noted wryly that in the stack of papers the Venezuelans had just handed him, they had accidentally left the private instructions not to discuss independence. ",
            "But one guy who was always willing to talk independence was Francisco de Miranda, who was thrilled by the news coming out of Caracas and eager now to brain dump his life’s work into Bolívar’s head. And during the two months that Bolívar remained in London, he and Miranda conferred constantly. They were practically inseparable. Miranda introduced Bolívar all around London, and they would stay up late plotting Spanish American independence all the way down to Miranda’s ideas for infrastructure improvements that could be undertaken after independence to improve the economic productivity of their country. They also agreed on one other thing: unity of purpose was essential, one of those we-all-must-hang-together-or-surely-we-shall-hang-separately things.",
            "Now, Miranda and Bolívar had both read their Montesquieu and did not think it was practical or even possible to have all of Spanish America centralized under a single government, but large states roughly conforming to the boundaries of the four viceroyalties sounded perfect. ",
            "Now, as we go forward, we’re going to see that the Spanish American revolutionaries, that is, setting aside unreconstructed conservatives who are opposed to all of this, could be divided along two axes. The X-axis was monarchist-republican, that is, do you want regional political autonomy under the sovereign umbrella of King Ferdinand, or do you really want pure independence? The Y-axis was centralist-federalist, that is, do you want a strong central government ruling a large territory, or do you prefer every city, province, and region holding ultimate sovereignty over itself? And as we’re about to see, the Caracas Junta, for example, was pretty much in the quadrant monarchist centralist. They wanted to rule Venezuela from Caracas but planned to remain loyal to Ferdinand. Other guys out there were republican federalists or monarchists federalists. Miranda and Bolívar are both republican centralists. They favor independence and a strong central government, and through everything that has to come, through all the fighting and all the negotiations, Bolívar would never leave this quadrant. He would remain a republican centralist.",
            "The Venezuelan envoys then continued to meet informally with Foreign Minister Wellesley and his agents over the next few months, but neither side changed their positions. Believing he had now done what he came to do, Bolívar decided in September 1810 to return to Venezuela, and in the run-up to his departure, he lobbied Miranda hard to come with him, though Miranda was understandably reluctant. The Leander Expedition had been a disaster, he was now 60 years old, he had a wife and children, and frankly, a very comfortable, respectable life in London. But Bolívar painted a picture very similar to the one Miranda had long ago painted for himself, that Miranda would return home to Caracas a liberating hero, and finally, Bolívar convinced the old man to come home. ",
            "Now, the two men intended to take the same ship home at the end of September 1810, but Bolívar would again be traveling courtesy of the Royal Navy. And at the last minute, Foreign Minister Wellesley decided it would be too provocative to the regency for the British Navy to transport Miranda back to Venezuela, since everyone in Europe and the Americas knew that Miranda only had one thing on his mind: independence. So while Bolívar departed England on September 22, Miranda was delayed until he could secure passage on a private ship, and he did not depart until October 3. Andrés Bello and Luis López Méndez, meanwhile, stayed behind in London. Bello got working on an intellectual PR campaign, and Méndez ultimately became the great logistical organizer for Bolívar’s patriot armies over the next decade. And he was so important to the cause that Bolívar would later say that it was Méndez who we should all actually be calling the Liberator.",
            "As Bolívar and Miranda set to depart, the fourth and fifth rebellions that I talked about at the beginning of today’s episode rocked Spanish America, and they hit almost simultaneously, even though they occurred on opposite sides of the empire. Down in Santiago, Chile, the local criollos had now learned not just of the fall of the Central Junta but also of the May Revolution over in Buenos Aires. Inspired by the example of the Río de la Plata, the locals of Santiago convened an open meeting of their town council on September 18, 1810. They deposed the local governor, who was a no-good, very bad man, and declared themselves autonomous under an independent junta. September 18 is now Chilean Independence Day and would mark the beginning of the Chilean War of Independence. ",
            "Then, way, way up in New Spain, the really big revolt finally broke. On September 16, 1810, the radical Father Hidalgo issued his famous Cry of Dolores that kicked off the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence, a tumultuous conflict that would engulf Mexico all the way until 1821, and which I said in the first episode of this series, we are not going to get into. But just know that New Spain right now is also exploding into a revolutionary mess.",
            "What I do want to talk about, though, is another key event that took place in September 1810: the convening in Cádiz of the Cortes. As I mentioned in passing two episodes back, since the beginning of the Peninsular War, the British have been pressing the patriot Spaniards to convene a real representative body that would enjoy greater political legitimacy than the self-declared juntas or now the self-declared regency, which, as you can see, the Americans are rejecting. So, just before fleeing Seville in January 1810, the Central Junta agreed to put out a call to convene a General Cortes. Now, you probably don’t remember this, but back in Episode 5.1, we briefly discussed the Cortes, which operated a bit like the French Estates-General. It was an old medieval council comprising the nobility, the clergy, and the commons. And what was on the table now was creating a pan-imperial Cortes that would resemble kind of the early days of the National Assembly, with representatives drawn from all the various Spanish administrative provinces and all the American provinces dumping into one congressional body. The call to join this Cortes would then supersede the call to join the Central Junta, which was fine because, like I said, none of the American representatives, save for one, ever made it to the Central Junta before it collapsed anyway. ",
            "So the situation in Iberia during 1810 was grim, but there was enough stability that the regency could now move forward with the plan to call the Cortes. Now, over the summer, the French had launched the third invasion of Portugal, but by then, Arthur Wellesley, future Duke of Wellington, had constructed major defensive lines around Lisbon, then halted the French advance and ultimately forced them into retreat, which would then lead to a general stalemate in 1811 that would give way to an allied offensive in 1812. ",
            "But in the summer of 1810, most of Spain was still occupied by the French, and Cádiz wound up being really the last city standing. So patriotic refugees streamed into the port from all over occupied Spain. Cádiz was now a bulging mass of people from all over the empire since it already included a community of Americans and residents, and it was from this available population that the first batch of delegates to the Cortes were drawn. On September 24, 1810, the first assembly of the Cortes convened. And in that first assembly, there were 104 delegates, 30 of them American-born. One of them was actually Bolívar’s uncle Esteban, the one who he had lived with as a teenager during his first stay in Madrid, the guy who had eventually gotten himself tossed in jail.",
            "Now, the first thing the Cortes did was declare itself to be the seat of Spanish sovereignty and the sole generator of Spanish law, which did not sit well with the existing five-man regency. But in the ensuing little power struggle, the Cortes emerged victorious. And one by one, each of the five regents was forced out of office. The old regency was then replaced with a new three-man body that would be there to execute the laws passed by the Cortes.",
            "So the first thing the American delegates tried to do was establish the principle of equal representation. The original decree sent out by the Central Junta had several clauses that we don’t need to get into, but the big one is that Spaniards would be represented at a rate of one delegate per 50,000 people, while Americans would be represented at a rate of one delegate per 100,000 people. And not just people, but a rate of one per 100,000 whites, which, I mean, at this point, the vast majority of the American population is Indian or black, mestizo, pardo, or some further combination thereof. So on day two of the Cortes, the American delegates presented a proposal to make their delegation equal at a rate of one per 50,000 free subjects of the king. And here lay the fate of the future of the Spanish Empire, because at the time it was believed that Spain had a population of about 10.5 million, while the Americas had a population of 15 to 16 million. Now, historians have decided that the latter numbers were probably inflated, but the implication here was obvious. Equal representation for the Americans meant an American-dominated Cortes, full stop!, which even for enlightened peninsular liberals, this was an intolerable shift in the balance of power. Plus, the Spaniards had one very strong rejoinder. The raw population in the Americas may be 15 to 16 million, but everyone knew that the criollo elite would be the ones deciding who represented the Americas. So in effect, “equal representation” would give a tiny minority of American whites, who numbered maybe two to three million, a controlling majority of the seats in the Cortes. ",
            "Now, this being a not unreasonable counterpoint, the two sides worked out a compromise that would have major implications for the future and represent a sea change in thinking about what constituted a citizen inside the Spanish Empire. After much wrangling, the two sides agreed on October 15 to a new formulation. Free subjects who could trace both sides of their ancestry back to Spanish domains would be considered for the purposes of representation. Those domains being Europe or America, which very, very obviously left out anyone from Africa. So, on the one hand, this is a pretty remarkable extension of political and civil rights, not just to mestizo but also to full-blooded Indians, all of whom were now legally equal to the purest, pure white peninsular. But this was accomplished specifically by eliminating blacks and mixed-race pardos from the equation. ",
            "Now, for the guys sitting in the Cortes, this all looked pretty good. The Americans would get more delegates, but by not counting anyone with African blood, the peninsulares still held a majority of the seats. But this new formulation turned out to be kind of disastrous because, for example, in Venezuela, the Indian and mestizo population wasn’t especially big, while the population of those with African blood was. And as we were about to see, those guys at this very moment are actually the strongest supporters of the regency in Venezuela against republican centralists like Bolívar. And guess how loyal they will stay when word comes across the Atlantic that they have just been excluded from the imperial government. ",
            "Before we head back to Venezuela for the arrival of Bolívar and Miranda, I’ll mention one other thing that would also help sync the legitimacy of the Cortes in the Americas. On December 11, the American delegates presented eleven propositions representing the core components of what they wanted out of the new order. Number one was recognition of the October 15 decree on equal representation. But the rest came down to various angles of free trade: no monopolies, unrestricted imports and exports, elimination of various taxes, equal access to government posts, and the civil service. Number eleven, though, returned to a long-held American grievance, demanding the return of the Jesuits. ",
            "Now, the problem with this list of free trade proposals, and indeed one of the fatal problems with the Cortes in general, was that the patriotic government was physically housed in Cádiz, and since 1717, Cádiz had been the monopoly port of entry and exit for all American trade. And even after the free trade decree of 1776, Cádiz still accounted for something like 90% of the American trade. The Cádiz merchant houses were still incredibly powerful, and they now had the government planted right in their front yard. And the really big stick the Cádiz merchants now held over the Cortes was that the patriotic war effort relied exclusively on taxes and revenues from the Americas for funding. And all those taxes and revenues were handled by the Cádiz merchants. It was kind of like they were a wholly independent Treasury Department. And so when the Americans presented the Cortes with a list of free trade demands, the Cádiz merchants were right there to tell the peninsular delegates, “Look, you do what you want. All we’re saying is there might be problems releasing the revenue you need to go fight the French if you try to undermine our monopolies in the Americas.” And you can imagine who won those battles. And so, even as the Cortes hoped that their new government would coax the rebellious Americans back into line, their idealistic liberal fantasies never much materialized in reality. And the reality wound up being way more important to the Americans than the fantasy.",
            "So, coming back now to Venezuela, Simón Bolívar arrived back in Caracas on December 5, just a few days before the American delegates presented the eleven propositions. He looked around, took stock of what had happened in the six months that he had been absent, and did not like what he saw. The Caracas Junta had taken a decidedly conservative turn and were now even more monarchist than when he had left. Meanwhile, efforts to bring the other Venezuelan cities under the leadership of the Caracas junta had mostly failed in the face of federalist resistance. The other principal cities in the province, like Maracaibo and Valencia and Coro, had gone ahead and formed their own juntas. But they refused to say, “Oh yeah, we’ll let the guys in Caracas call all the shots. I mean, why should they get to run themselves but not us?” So Bolívar is a republican centralist who found himself surrounded by either monarchists on the one hand, federalists on the other, or horror of horrors, a combination of the two. ",
            "And this is all to say nothing of the large black and pardo population I just talked about who are filling the streets of Caracas. They were convinced that any separation from Spain would leave them at the mercy of now unchecked criollo race prejudice, and things for them would get worse than ever. Remember, in the latter days of the Bourbon Reforms, the peninsular officials coming in were enforcing rollbacks to the racial caste system, rollbacks that had been opposed by the criollos, who now controlled the juntas, who were saying, “We don’t take orders from peninsular officials anymore.”",
            "The Caracas Junta, though, had done a number of things Bolívar approved of. They wasted no time, for example, enacting the now standard-issue big white reform package. They abolished all export duties, ended the much-hated sales tax, they declared free and open trade with every other nation, and committed themselves to home rule, though under the sovereignty of King Ferdinand. They also replaced the peninsular-dominated audiencia, most of whose members had already fled anyway, with the criollo-dominated high court. They also called for the convening of a province-wide congress that would meet in Caracas, using a version of the old active-passive citizen distinction we talked about during the French Revolution. So property owners would be allowed to vote and be represented. The landless poor would not. ",
            "But they did go a little bit further than we’ve seen so far, except for the little La Paz revolution of 1809. The Caracas Junta voted to end what little Indian forced labor still existed in Venezuela, and then they abolished the special Indian tribute that the Indians had been forced to pay all these years. They also voted to outlaw the slave trade. Now, they are not outlawing slavery, just the trade. And I’ve not seen this argued anywhere, but I personally wonder how much of this was to bring Venezuelan trade policy in line with the British slave trade act of 1807 because the British were bound to be one of their principal trading partners for the foreseeable future, and they had already abolished the slave trade. But that is 100% speculation on my part.",
            "Miranda arrived just a few days after Bolívar. He showed up on December 10, and he would immediately discover that the young firebrand had maybe possibly oversold the situation in Venezuela. Bolívar did manage to hustle together a crowd to go greet Miranda at the docks when he arrived. And in anticipation for what he thought was going to be a momentous occasion, Miranda emerged from the ship wearing nothing less than his old French revolutionary general’s uniform. But it soon became clear how manufactured the greeting really was. Only one member of the Caracas Junta attended the welcome ceremony, and he was only there to deliver a curt greeting to the old exile before departing. Not only was the membership of the junta now trending monarchist and conservative, most of those guys were also in their mid to late 30s. They had literally not been born yet when Miranda last actually lived amongst them. Remember, he hasn’t lived in Venezuela since 1771. So to them, he was the embarrassment of the Leander Expedition, a troublemaker exile working for the British, not somebody to be embraced. And there’s even some historical debate about whether the junta had told Bolívar not to make contact with Miranda while in London. Like that was even possible. Mostly, though, they didn’t trust him and they really didn’t want him around. ",
            "So Miranda took up lodgings with Bolívar until he could secure a place of his own to live. And while the junta didn’t quite know what to do with him and didn’t really want him, he did have a few friends and pen pals from his years in exile, and as we just discussed, probably a few fellow Masons around. So the junta commissioned him Lieutenant General in the militia with commensurate pay and privileges. But this was more of a snub than anything else, because clearly Miranda has been led to believe, or he led himself to believe, that he would be made, like, Supreme Commander in Chief of the Venezuelan Patriot Army. I mean, there was literally no one in Venezuela with a longer and more distinguished war record than him. ",
            "With elections to the coming Congress underway and the junta trying to keep more radical republicans at arm’s length, Miranda and Bolívar then set out to wage something no one in Caracas had ever seen before: a real, actual political campaign. Miranda was by now well-versed in British-style electioneering, and since no one else had a clue about it, he and Bolívar and their allies pretty much had the floor to themselves. The first thing they did, and I really do love this, and it’s why it’s the title of the episode, they identified a sleepy little trade organization called the Patriotic Society for the Development of Agriculture and Livestock. Presumably, it was a group of ranchers lobbying to make sure the junta included their interests and all the economic reforms they were passing. Well, Bolívar, Miranda, and a small cadre of allies walked into the Patriotic Society one day, signed themselves up as members, and then just took it over, turning it into a party machine for the advancement of their more radical agenda. Because remember, kids, sometimes it’s easier to go take over an existing organization than trying to start a whole new one from scratch. ",
            "From their base in the Patriotic Society, they then took over a newspaper and started pumping out editorials and pamphlets and sending Miranda around to give speeches. Now, Miranda is incredibly charming and charismatic, of course, but more importantly, he could speak eloquently to the mostly mixed-race crowds about the humiliation his own family had endured at the hands of the arrogant criollo, just because the Mirandas came from the Canary Islands. Miranda then managed to secure himself a place in the new Congress as a delegate from the town of El Pao. And then came the really big coup. The Patriotic Society secured control of the Caracas Gazette, the paper of record in the capital city, which they then used to pump out more pro-independence editorials, which now had something resembling an official seal of approval. The more conservative criollos just couldn’t keep up with this organized rallying of public opinion that they had, frankly, never encountered before.",
            "On March 2, 1811, the Congress finally met, 31 members from seven outlying provinces. But not nearly all of Venezuela was represented, because the problem of federalism would continue to plague them. The Congress proceeded to try to create the foundations for an autonomous government and the permanent implementation of their slate of big white reforms. But at the end of June 1811, a scandal rocked the Congress, and suddenly the great issue Miranda and Bolívar had been working towards and rallying public opinion towards was at hand. It turned out that one of the Congressmen was a plant whose loyalties actually lay with the regency back in Spain. At the end of June, he bundled up confidential war department assessments of Venezuela’s defenses and skipped town. So on July 1, one of the Congressmen rose and said, “We need to decide this issue of political sovereignty once and for all. Are we going to live under the thumbs of the peninsulares forever, or aren’t we?” The Patriotic Society then sprang into action, creating a healthy buzz in the Caracas streets in favor of declaring total independence. And on the night of July 4, the auspicious date not lost on those who knew their recent history of the United States, Bolívar led a great revelry of speechmaking inside the Patriotic Society in favor of independence. ",
            "Then, on July 5, 1811, the Congress met, and they listened as Miranda read war dispatches from Spain. The war was now starting to go in favor of the Spanish and the British. And in the heat of this particular moment, this struck a note of fear in their hearts rather than joy. Because once the French had been expelled and Spain reconsolidated, it was inevitable that the old regime would try to come back and undo everything that they had now done over the past year. Whether you are a monarchist or a republican, it was obvious that maintaining home rule meant acting now before it was too late. With only one dissenting vote, the Congress voted to declare independence, and the first Republic of Venezuela was born. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "On July 5, 1811, Venezuela declared independence from Spain. Well, at least part of Venezuela declared independence from Spain. The Congress that had convened in Caracas lacked representatives from most of the western half of the province, as no other major city wanted to be ruled by Caracas. And then on the other side, there was the matter of who exactly they were declaring independence from. Most of Spain at this point was being ruled by the French Bonaparte monarchy that nobody had recognized since its inception way back in 1808. So really, the Congress in Caracas was declaring independence from the regency that was holed up in the port of Cádiz and its allegedly pan-Imperial Cortes that had been convened there. So the Declaration of Independence was really some guys in the region around Caracas declaring independence from another group of guys who were trapped in Cádiz. But still, it was a momentous day, and the patriots in Caracas, Simón Bolívar and Francisco de Miranda chief among them, set out to make their play for freedom permanent. Today is the story of their abject failure to do so.",
            "The mood in Caracas immediately after the Declaration of Independence was jubilant and turbulent. Gangs of patriotic citizens, the kind that had been roused to life by the Patriotic Society for the Development of Agriculture and Livestock, marched around, harassing and disarming all remaining peninsulares and anyone suspected of being a royalist, that is, anyone who still professed loyalty to King Ferdinand. And though the mixed-race pardo community and even the free blacks in the capital were wary of the new regime, for the first few weeks, they joined in the excitement. They joined militias and requested full and equal access to all offices and opportunities. And they really did hope that maybe this would be the start of a real egalitarian liberation project. They would be very disappointed on that front.",
            "Now, the backlash in Caracas at this point, though, was pretty minimal. On July 11, a small insurrection broke out in the northwest part of the city, but it turned out to be 60 guys and was easily crushed. Sixteen of them were summarily executed, hanged, and their bodies then dismembered. But elsewhere, dangers to the new republic rose up on multiple fronts. The most obvious was that the other major cities in Venezuela: Maracaibo, Coro, Valencia had never sent representatives to the Congress, and they were not interested in taking orders from it. And indeed, when Caracas declared independence, those cities in western Venezuela just as loudly proclaimed their continued loyalty to King Ferdinand.",
            "But if you remember from last time, we talked about the four quadrants of Spanish American revolutionaries, right? You had your monarchist centralist, which is what the old Caracas Junta had been. Then you had republican centralists like Bolívar and Miranda. Republican federalists, which is what the first Congress is actually going to morph into as they try to appease these western cities. And then monarchist federalists, which is what those western cities were. So they were pledging fealty to the king, but they are also demanding local home rule. They intended to be as free from Cádiz as they were from Caracas, just under the umbrella of their shared sovereign, King Ferdinand.",
            "But the even bigger danger looming over the new republic was that the elite criollo serving in the Caracas Congress had no intention of touching the racial caste system. Yes, they made a few grand rhetorical gestures and had gone so far as to outlaw the slave trade, but for them, freedom meant freedom for the elite criollo, not necessarily for anybody else. So, for example, any slave that thought that the end of the slave trade might mean the end of slavery was immediately disabused of that notion. Then the free blacks and pardos who joined the patriot militias found themselves dumped in segregated companies run by white officers. Then, as peninsulares abandoned their various posts, criollos stepped into the void without doing much to offer anyone else a shot at those jobs. It soon became clear to the non-white population of Venezuela that their initial suspicions were true: freedom meant freedom for the whites, not for anybody else. And the Congress did not help matters by moving forward with their own version of the active-passive citizen distinction. So property holders like themselves could expect both civil rights and political rights, the right to vote and to stand for office. But everybody else would have to settle for mere civil rights, protection from abuse, but no active participation in government.",
            "Now, for the circle surrounding guys like Miranda and Bolívar, this attitude was massively counterproductive. Most of the population was poor or they were mixed-race or they were both. So the best way to survive as a new Republic in a dangerous world was to harness the energy of the whole population, get them all pulling in the same direction, not go looking for ways to cut out huge swathes of that population and set them down on the sidelines. And it’s worth noting too here, that Miranda and Bolívar and other members of the Patriotic Society did skew more radically enlightened on matters of race and class, especially Miranda. He’s not a slave owner at this point, and his contact with reformers like William Wilberforce had made him far more broadminded than most of his contemporaries. Bolívar, meanwhile, was also not wedded to the caste system, and if clinging to it undermined the legitimacy of the new Republic, he was happy to ditch it or at least reform it, but he was still a slave owner, and his worldview hadn’t yet shaken off all of its old prejudices. And all that said, both men were acutely afraid that this would all turn into the Haitian Revolution, and so they would never press anyone to move too far or too fast on the subject of race.",
            "But by entrenching local white rule, the republicans opened a huge breach for the royalists to step into. Royalist agitators started going around educating the blacks and the pardos about the obvious intention of the Caracas Congress to enshrine elite white rule as the order of the new Republic. And taking the lead in that effort were members of the Catholic Church, from the Archbishop of Caracas on down to local parish priests, the word went out that a bunch of selfish radicals in Caracas were trying to spit in the face of both God and the king, and that following them down the path to hell would be their ruin. It was not a particularly hard sell, and pretty soon, almost the entire mixed-race population of Venezuela had abandoned the Republic. It was not unlike the coloreds of Saint-Domingue sticking with the French in the face of the big white push for home rule. Because, I mean, you call it home rule and you call it freedom, but I’m personally going to have it even worse than ever, so why should I support you? And then, on top of that, royalists started taking an even more radical line. They went out amongst the slaves and told them that, “Nope, you guys are just going to be kept in chains forever. You’re going to have to break them for yourselves.” And in all regions containing major commercial estates, slave uprisings became an endemic problem, which only made the Congress dig in even harder. ",
            "Now, though, I’ve been talking about Miranda and Bolívar as if they both agree about everything, cracks were now beginning to open up between them that will come to a head at the end of today’s episode. And these cracks seem to have followed two principal fault lines. The first was simply that friction exists between any two ambitious, egotistical men, which Miranda and Bolívar both certainly were, especially when you throw in the fact that one is old and wants deference, and the other is young and wants respect. The other fault line, though, was that Miranda apparently had a running feud with the Del Toro family, especially with the family patriarch, the Marquis Del Toro. These two did not see eye to eye on much of anything. And of course, the Del Toros are also Bolívar’s old in-laws and were amongst his closest friends. I mean, for all intents and purposes, they were his family, and he remained close to them throughout this period of partnership with Miranda. Meanwhile, Miranda was getting a little annoyed at Bolívar’s divided loyalties, especially after Congress sprayed some gas on the feud when they made Del Toro Minister of War over Miranda. Bolívar is just caught in the middle of all this. ",
            "But the Marquis Del Toro was not going to turn out to have been a very good choice for Minister of War, and he would fail the very first test that the Republic faced. On July 19, an armed insurrection broke out in the town of Valencia, just west of Caracas. The mostly mixed-race population swore allegiance to King Ferdinand and rejected the authority of the Caracas Congress. This now being a major test of resolve, the Marquis del Toro organized the armed forces at the Republic’s disposal and marched on Valencia. But the old Marquis wasn’t really a military commander, nor his men really soldiers. At the first sign of real resistance in Valencia, they retreated without putting up much of a fight at all. ",
            "So the embarrassed Congress then had to turn back to Miranda and say, “Okay, you are now the Commander in Chief of the army. Please go subdue Valencia.” But before Miranda could leave to take up his command, the strain between him and Bolívar spilled out into the open.",
            "Now Bolívar naturally expected to be taken along with Miranda. But Miranda told the Congress not to assign Bolívar to any important position in the military, and that he was, in fact, a dangerous young man. When Bolívar heard about this, he stormed into the Congress and blustered about his aggrieved honor, and he did kind of have a point. But the situation was ultimately resolved when the Marquis Del Toro, who was still over in Valencia, would take Bolivar onto his personal staff at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.",
            "So General Miranda and Lieutenant Colonel Bolívar arrived at Valencia with some reinforcements at the end of July, bringing the total size of the Patriot Army to somewhere between 2,000 and 2,500 men, almost all of them white, and they fought against about 750 men who were defending the town walls of Valencia, almost all of them mixed-race. But despite the numerical advantage, Miranda was not impressed with his army. Most of his troops lacked proper guns, and they had never undertaken any kind of official training. In fact, many of them had been persuaded to do their patriotic duty and join the army at the end of a sharp sword, if you catch my draft. ",
            "And thus began Miranda’s very bad relationship with the rank and file. He was dismissive of them and very condescending, saying that they were an absolutely rotten lot, the worst soldiers he had ever seen. He frequently spoke in English and French, which did nothing to make them think that he was actually one of them. And that doesn’t even get into his tactics, which they were not too thrilled about, because upon arrival, Miranda staged a first attack that saw his main column walk into a cannon ambush that resulted in heavy casualties and the failure of the attack. So then Miranda regrouped, surrounded Valencia, and successfully cut off their water supply. He then was able to launch a second and far more successful attack, but he took a play out of the old French revolutionary playbook and just threw his superior numbers at the enemy, hoping to overwhelm them, whatever the human cost. So on August 13, Valencia did finally capitulate. But the combined dead and wounded on the patriot side numbered as much as 50% of the army. So it’s pretty safe to say that Francisco de Miranda was not the most popular general in the history of the world. ",
            "The battles around Valencia, though, also marked the first time Simón Bolívar saw combat. And by all accounts, he performed exceptionally well. He was brave, cool under pressure, a natural leader in the chaos of war. Even Miranda, who had tried to keep him off the battlefield, not only recommended Bolívar for medals but also afforded him the honor of being the man to carry news of the capture of Valencia back to Caracas.",
            "Now Bolívar’s first brush with war here is not going to end well, as we soon shall see. But the attributes that would make him such a remarkable and beloved general, unlike Miranda, were all present at Valencia.",
            "Despite this victory, though, the Republic was unable or maybe unwilling to make further military inroads. The Congress didn’t really want to be fighting a civil war against their brothers in Coro and Maracaibo. Miranda, especially, was not happy that after finally being made Commander in Chief of the great Patriot Army of independent Venezuela, that he was fighting a civil war against other Venezuelans rather than a war of liberation against the hated Spanish. So military action took a backseat to political maneuvering. And as the Congress worked on the constitution that they hoped would define the government of the new Republic, they tried to include as many olive branches as possible that would bring all of Venezuela over to their side.",
            "Now, as these patriots in Caracas tried to really make the French Republic work, the Cortes in Cadiz was in a similar bind as they tried to craft a new liberal constitution that would govern the Spanish Empire. 1811 was a year of stalemate in the Peninsular War, this being the era where something like 350,000 French troops had been brought into the peninsula, but most of them had been dispersed in garrisons or guarding supply routes and under constant demoralizing harassment by local Spanish guerrillas.",
            "But the sword of Damocles hanging over Cádiz had been somewhat secured. And so the Cortes spent the back half of 1811 crafting the framework of a constitutional monarchy that they hoped would govern the Spanish Empire after the hopefully inevitable expulsion of the French. The document they ultimately produced was indeed very liberal and took many elements from the early constitutions of the French Revolution. So sovereignty would now lay with the people, not with the king. And more than that, it would lay with the whole people. Borrowing from that old concept of the French nation, one and indivisible, the members of the Cortes tried to codify that there was no longer a mother country and colonies or even separate kingdoms under a single crown, but rather just one Spain. Whether you lived in Lima or Mexico City or Madrid or Manila. One Spain, one law.",
            "But as we discussed last time, who counted as a Spaniard in this one Spain now lay in the compromise that had already been hashed out over the issue of representation in the Cortes. Those who could trace their lineage to Spanish dominions in Europe or America were counted. If you could trace your lineage back to Africa, you were not.",
            "So on the one hand, this is a pretty radical admission that all the Indians and mestizos are equal to whites, but it shut out the blacks and pardos. And this was a compromise that would come back to bite them because as we just saw, and as we will continue to see, the blacks and the pardos are absolutely ready to pledge their loyalty to the Cádiz government. But the Cádiz government is sitting there pretending like they don’t even exist.",
            "Now, we don’t need to worry too much else about the Constitution of 1812, as it would become known, because while the guys in the Cortes were happy with it, it limited the powers of the king, it made the Cortes the creator of all law, it put the monarchy on a fixed allowance. None of it was ever really going to be put into practice. When the restoration did finally come, King Ferdinand VII planned to pretend like nothing at all had changed since the day he abdicated the throne back in 1808. And he certainly wasn’t planning on accepting the liberal Constitution of 1812. But that was still in the future.",
            "For the moment, the problem with the constitution was that it failed to really do much to appease the Americans. As we also discussed last week, the American principal demands were for free trade, equal rights, and home rule. And those were all pretty much brushed aside. Because even as they talked about one Spain, the peninsular delegates of the Cortes couldn’t shake their unconscious prejudice against the Americans as simply an inferior breed to rule over, not rule with. And the Cádiz merchants were not going to let anybody undo their trade privileges.",
            "So while the Constitution of 1812 is justly celebrated in Spain as a liberal enlightened document, I mean, hey, look, freedom of the press, it did nothing to bring the Americans back into the fold or halt the spread of these independence movements. New Spain was currently being overrun by revolutionary armies, although Father Hidalgo himself was captured and executed in July 1811. And then down in the Río de la Plata, the convoluted little revolution/civil war was unfolding with equal fury. And over in Chile, a liberal republican regime had successfully tossed out their governor, and they were busy writing their own independent constitution. ",
            "So in the face of all this turmoil and the threat it posed to peninsular trade and revenue, the Cádiz government undertook measures to pacify the American domains and force them to recognize their authority. And then eventually, when they promulgated it, the Constitution of 1812. And in particular, it was the Cádiz merchants who undertook this project of pacification, seeing as how they were the only people with any money to pay for anything. So over the winter of 1811-1812, the merchants started outfitting expeditions to the various trouble spots in the Americas to reinforce peninsular authority.",
            "Now, of course, with the Peninsular War still raging, it’s not like they could just send huge armies to put the rebels down. And by the spring of 1812, only about 6,000 men total would be sent over to the Western Hemisphere. But most of those who were sent were officers. And they also took with them weapons and ammunition and supplies to reinforce locals who were still loyal to Spain. And as we’re about to see, a couple of hundred well-armed soldiers could recruit and train armies of counter-revolutionary locals to fight for the cause.",
            "Now, speaking of constitutions that were never actually going to be implemented, in December 1811, the Caracas Congress finally completed theirs. And much to the dismay of Bolívar and Miranda, it was a self-consciously federalist piece of work. As I said, it was designed mostly to coax wary towns like Maracaibo and Coro into the union. They also moved the capital from Caracas to Valencia to try to prove that the government would not be held hostage by the Caracas aristocracy. It also did nothing about the social and racial hierarchy of the Republic, aside from permanently abolishing the special tribute paid by the Amerindian communities. Now, this seems pretty benevolent until you realize that they paid that tribute in lieu of any other taxes or obligations to the state. So lifting the tribute meant they were now liable to be taxed by Caracas at a rate higher than the tribute had ever been. So it’s safe to say that the criollo leadership of the First Republic had pretty much alienated everyone by the time the first new Congress under the Constitution convened in March 1812. ",
            "Now when that Congress convened, the man who would destroy them in the end, the man who would become the bane of the patriot cause had already landed in Coro. His name was Domingo de Monteverde. ",
            "Monteverde was a native of the Canary Islands and a career naval officer. When he arrived in Venezuela, he was simply a frigate captain, nothing more and nothing less. He arrived to support the efforts of the man who had been appointed by the Cortes to become the new Captain General of Venezuela, a Cuban-born officer named Fernando Miyares. Now, Coro welcomed the small force of soldiers and marines and sailors that arrived with the new Captain General to reassert loyalty to Spain, and Coro became the base of the anti-republican campaign of 1812.",
            "But though Miyares was supposed to be the ultimate authority in that campaign, Monteverde proved himself to be so resourceful, aggressive, and independent to the point of insubordinate, that the frigate captain was, in short order, the de facto Commander in Chief of the royalist army.",
            "In early March 1812, Monteverde was dispatched, along with a couple of hundred men, to link up with a pro-royalist insurrection in a small town just south of Coro and due west of Caracas. He entered this town on March 17th and immediately exceeded his orders by recruiting reinforcements from the local population. Again, we’re talking about mostly mixed-race guys here. And his intention was then to advance on Caracas and recruit all along the road. I mean, really, this is the plan that Miranda had once envisioned for himself during the Leander Expedition, except now in reverse.",
            "So, in March of 1812, things are looking not great for the Republic. Successfully defending themselves from all the dangers that surrounded them was not going to be easy. And then a whole new danger lurched up out of nowhere when the Republic was attacked by no less an enemy than almighty God. And it’s never great for your cause when God comes out against you.",
            "So if you remember back two episodes ago, the coup that ousted Captain General Emparán took place on April 19, 1810, but more significantly, it took place during Holy Week on Maundy Thursday. Well, since Easter wanders around the calendar like a drunk stumbling home from the bar, in 1812, Maundy Thursday landed not on April 19, but on March 26. So it was that on this spiritual second anniversary, disaster struck Caracas. Massive, unfathomable disaster.",
            "By the afternoon of March 26, 1812, all the churches in town were packed with parishioners, and the cathedral itself, one of the oldest and largest buildings in the city, was filled to the brim. In their barracks, soldiers prepared for parade. And out in the streets, everybody went about their business as if nothing was about to happen. But then, at 4:00 p.m., a massive earthquake hit. It shook the city for the better part of two minutes. Now, obviously, there’s no way to know what the quake measured on the Richter scale, but the scale of destruction could only mean that it was huge. The great cathedral? It was demolished to its foundations. It crushed everyone inside. All those other churches? Demolished to their foundations. In fact, nearly every major municipal structure was leveled to its foundations. There was a degree to which if you were inside when the earthquake hit, you were just dead. For the next 30 minutes, dust and screams and crashes and chaos swirled as the dazed residents of Caracas tried through their shock to register what had just happened. I mean, what do you do first when everywhere you look is just sudden complete destruction? How do you even process it? That 30 minutes ended when the first major aftershock hit, which took down any structure still hanging on for dear life. And many of those who lived through the first quake did not make it through the aftershock.",
            "Now, I haven’t been able to track down exactly where Francisco de Miranda was during all of this, but I would guess that he was up in Valencia. But everybody knows where Bolívar was because it became a part of his growing legend. He was immediately spotted on top of a pile of rubble in a loose shirt, organizing efforts to dig out what, if any, survivors could be found. I mean, Bolivar is legitimately great at this sort of thing. The whole running towards the fire to help rather than running away from the fire to stay safe. And on top of this pile of rubble, he is alleged to have shouted, “If nature itself decides to oppose us, we will fight and force her to obey.” ",
            "Without tools or time to actually think anything through, Bolívar and the others dug with their bare hands. There weren’t very many survivors, though, and soon the screams subsided and the bodies started to pile up. So many bodies that a mass grave was deemed insufficient, and anonymous funeral pyres began to be lit across the city. Estimates are, of course, estimates that have been passed down through the years. But conservatively, the death toll was somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000. ",
            "The Caracas earthquake of 1812 was a catastrophic tragedy in human terms. And it was also the beginning of the end of the First Republic. The royalist clergy wasted 0.0 seconds before blaming the tragedy on God’s divine wrath. Caracas had turned its back on God and the King, and look at what has happened Now, I mean, the clergy would have exploited the earthquake had it happened at any point. But Maundy Thursday, I mean, the anniversary of the coup, it was impossible to ignore. And there is a more apocryphal story surrounding the legend of Bolívar that he happened to cross a priest in the immediate aftermath of the quake, telling the day’s survivors to repent and turn back to the light of God and the King. And Bolívar pulled out a saber and chased the priest off. ",
            "But let’s face it, the earthquake as divine retribution was a story that was going to have legs. And the icing on the top of the cake was that over the next few weeks, it became clear where the earthquake had caused the most destruction, and all of that destruction was in patriot-held republican territory. Cities that had stayed loyal to God and the King, like Maracaibo and Coro, they were all fine and dandy. So in the weeks and months that followed, many families who had gone along with the republican tale now said, “Nope, I am done. I am going back to God and the King.”",
            "With this major crisis at hand, the Caracas Congress reconvened and decided extraordinary measures were needed. On April 23, 1812, they appointed Francisco de Miranda, Generalissimo with dictatorial powers. And for all intents and purposes, Miranda’s word was now law, at least wherever the Republic’s authority extended, which was fewer and fewer places by the day.",
            "With Monteverde’s army continuing to advance east, Miranda decided on May 3 that he could not hold Valencia, and he retreated, leaving the once rebellious city to fall back into rebellion, though at this point it was kind of hard to tell who the quote unquote “rebels” really were. ",
            "But though I’m obviously now moving us towards the inevitable fall of the first Venezuelan Republic, the armed forces Miranda commanded still vastly outnumbered those of Monteverde. Miranda at this point had about 5,000 men under arms. Now, not all of them were in one place, but they did number far more than the 1,500 or so who now formed the core of Monteverde’s army. But again, those guys under Miranda’s command are not well armed or trained, and many had been pressed into service. So who knows what would happen if you actually tried to get them to fight for you. They’d probably all desert at this point.",
            "So rather than attacking, Miranda settled into a strategy of cautious defense. After retreating out of Valencia at the beginning of May, he just kept retreating until he arrived in the town of La Victoria on June 20. Now there, the patriots were attacked by Monteverde’s forces. And the patriots acquitted themselves actually quite well. They didn’t desert, they actually fought and won the battle. But either because Miranda had lost his edge or felt the moral energy of the patriot cause slipping away, or maybe he was just never that great of a commander to begin with, he did not follow up on this victory and try to turn the tide. Instead, he settled in like he really was just waiting for the end to come. ",
            "Now, meanwhile, Bolívar, a man who would always fight, who would never desert, and who would always push for more aggressive action, was currently sitting glumly in the city of Puerto Cabello. After becoming dictator, Miranda had given Bolívar the critical job of defending this critical port city, which had in it a fort which happened to contain all of the patriots’ heavy guns and ammunition. It was really the republican storehouse. This was a very important job, but it also looked a lot like Miranda was once again trying to keep Bolívar back from the front lines. And Bolívar certainly did not appreciate the assignment and considered it to be a slight rather than an honor. And so he sat, unable to do anything about the reports he read of Miranda’s constant retreating.",
            "Now it was perhaps it was because he was in such a funk that Colonel Bolívar did not pay close enough attention to the internal threats he faced in Puerto Cabello. Specifically, the fort in the city held not just the patriot armory but also an assortment of high-ranking royalist prisoners who had been captured over the course of the last year. With enthusiasm for the patriot cause at this point at an all-time low, it was not out of the question that subterfuge and discontentment orchestrated by these royalist prisoners would threaten the patriot hold on the city. And that’s exactly what happened. ",
            "On June 30, everything fell apart. The second-in-command of the fort had already turned traitor and was just waiting for an opportunity, which came along when the senior commander of the fort left to go attend a wedding for the evening. And yes, it is upon such things as history hinges. Left in charge of the fort for the night, the second-in-command went around and let out all the royalist prisoners out of their cells, and then they went and took control of the armory. Now, whether any of the other soldiers up in the fort resisted this is pretty doubtful, because defections from the patriot cause were now a daily occurrence. I mean, now, the minute the fort announced it was now a royalist stronghold, the company guarding the main gates of Puerto Cabello declared their solidarity with them and refused to take orders from Bolívar anymore. ",
            "Now, being the brash guy that he was, Bolívar came out of his house and demanded that the guys in the fort surrender. Whereupon, the guys in the fort turned their guns on the city and said, “Yeah, do your worst.” And there was no worst for Bolívar to do. The shelling started up, and all Colonel Bolívar could do was take cover with the other residents and watch as nearly every soldier under his command deserted or defected. He also learned that a 500-man detachment from Monteverde’s army was on the way. And so he sent a desperate dispatch to Miranda: “Send me reinforcements at once!”",
            "But, Miranda did not get this dispatch until July 5. He was in fact sitting around with his senior staff, toasting the first anniversary of the Declaration of Independence when Bolívar’s frantic letter arrived. Allegedly, Miranda said, “That is the way of the world. A little while ago, we thought we were all secure. Yesterday, Monteverde had neither weapons nor ammunition. Today, he has both in abundance. I am told to attack the enemy, but he already has everything in his hands. Tomorrow, we shall see what happens.”",
            "And tomorrow, what happened was that Bolívar gave up. He had with him now just five officers and three enlisted men still willing to follow his orders. This small company slipped out of town on July 6. And on July 7, Bolívar arrived in La Guaira, the main port serving Caracas, where he wrote a now-famous letter defending his conduct. He said, ",
            "“My spirits are so low that I do not feel I have the courage now to command a single soldier. My vanity had me believing that desire and patriotic zeal alone could offset my lack of experience. I beg you now to assign me to an officer of the lowest rank or grant me a few days to compose myself. After 13 sleepless nights, under extreme conditions, I find myself in a rare state of mental ruin. I did my duty, General, and had one of my soldiers stayed, I would have fought to the end. But they abandoned me, and alas, the nation is lost at my hands.”",
            "Bolívar’s sense of shame over what had happened and the way it had happened was going to haunt him. And though it is never reported, it is entirely possible that he swore one of those ironclad oaths to never let anything like that happen again, which would kind of help explain one of the darkest marks on Bolívar’s career, which is going to be coming up when we discuss the war to the death. ",
            "When Miranda learned that Puerto Cabello had indeed finally fallen, all the energy went out of him. Despite still having superior overall numbers, he felt the walls closing in and sought to salvage what could be salvaged by negotiation. On July 12, he opened talks with Monteverde to surrender the Patriot Army and return Venezuela to the fold of the Spanish Empire. But these talks were handled by intermediaries because Miranda had more important things on his mind, like how to successfully extract himself from this disaster. He sent his luggage down to La Guaira, where a British naval ship just so happened to be waiting for him. And then, infamously, he also directed that a large chunk of the state treasury—talking silver here mostly—and ordered that it be carried onto this British naval ship as well.",
            "Now, Miranda would later claim that this was because he planned to eventually sail for Cartagena, where the republicans could regroup and carry on the fight. But to his more patriotic brethren, who had a lot more to lose in Venezuela than he did, it looked a lot like Miranda was surrendering without a fight and then running off with the Republic’s money, with the British acting as his prearranged getaway driver. They were not happy about it at all. All of which sets the stage now for the ultimately tragic final chapter for our friend Francisco de Miranda. ",
            "The final armistice was signed on July 25. The Patriot Army was now officially dissolved. In exchange for this, Monteverde agreed to a blanket pardon for the patriots and said that he would not touch their property, and that he would issue passports to anyone who now wanted to leave the country. Miranda himself, of course, wanted to leave the country, and he made his way down to La Guaira as fast as possible. But there, a plot was already afoot to not let the precursor get away quite so easily. And at the center of this conspiracy was Simón Bolívar. ",
            "Miranda arrived down at the port late and was convinced by a patriotic innkeeper that it would be better to eat and rest and sail in the morning. “All of your luggage and all of the silver has been loaded onto the British ship. All you’ll have to do is get up in the morning and go.”",
            "But that night, twelve disgruntled Patriot officers met to discuss whether they were really going to go through with what they were planning on going through with. And they talked themselves into quite a lather about how Miranda had led them to ruin and was now trying to run for it. And they decided that they were going to go through with it—that Miranda was not going to get on a ship and sail away; he was going to go down with the ship that was the Republic of Venezuela.",
            "At 3:00 a.m., these men took over the inn. They posted guards to prevent anyone from entering, and then they banged on Miranda’s door and demanded that he present himself. The old General soon recognized what was afoot. He donned his uniform and presented himself. A heated exchange then unfolded as they accused Miranda of treachery and he tried to defend himself. But the officers had made up their minds. They took Miranda into custody, marched him down to the fort, and tossed him in the dungeon in chains. They planned to leave him for the Spanish to do with as they pleased. Miranda would never again breathe free air.",
            "Simón Bolívar was now himself at a crossroads. And as the patriots who had arrested Miranda broke up, it was pretty much every man for himself. Now, despite all his promises to the contrary, when Monteverde entered Caracas in early August, still mostly a pile of rubble, he had no intention of doing anything but cracking down on the rebel scum. He ordered the ports closed; he was going to issue no passports, and patriot property was fair game for confiscation.",
            "Bolívar, though, was incredibly lucky, which, as you may have noticed over the course of all the podcasts we’ve been through together, is something all great men have in common. Being part of the inner circle criollo aristocracy meant Bolívar had friends on both sides of the lines. And he was able to seek asylum with an old family friend who happened to be a staunch royalist administrator, whom Monteverde happened to trust very highly. So this guy arranged for Bolívar to get a passport, but at the meeting where Bolívar was supposed to come down and get this passport, Monteverde was like, “I’ve heard of this guy. I hear he’s one of the most radical of the bunch.” But he decided to go ahead and issue the passport anyway when he was told of the role that Bolívar had played in apprehending the traitor Miranda. But then Bolívar interrupted and said, “I didn’t arrest Miranda to curry favor with you. I arrested him because he turned out to be a traitor to the patriot cause.” And so Monteverde was like, “Wait, what did you just say?” And Bolívar’s old family friend had to literally step into the middle of this and say, “Look, you be quiet. You please issue the passport, and let’s just get this kid out of here.”",
            "So the passport was issued, and on August 27, 1812, Bolívar sailed away from Venezuela for exile, not entirely sure where he would wind up. The name Bolívar would then haunt Monteverde for the rest of his natural life.",
            "So the First Republic is now crushed. It had failed in the face of near universal dislike for the men who had run it. The other cities had refused to stand in solidarity with Caracas. The mixed-race population saw no reason to support their brand of big white supremacy. The church thought them sacrilegious traitors against God, who had been justly punished for their transgressions."

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "The first Venezuelan Republic fell in the summer of 1812 when Francisco de Miranda surrendered the patriot army to the royalist general, Domingo de Monteverde. Now Monteverde made extravagant promises about respecting patriot lives and property, but in the aftermath of Miranda’s surrender and the capture of Caracas, Monteverde dropped any pretense of benevolence. Republican leaders were arrested, property was confiscated, and the ports were closed to prevent anyone from getting away. Hardcore patriots were now forced to either prostrate themselves before Monteverde and hope for mercy or make a run for it. And as we saw at the end of last week’s episode, Simón Bolívar engaged in a bit of both, using a high place connection to secure a passport. But many of his republican comrades had to essentially smuggle themselves out of Venezuela any way they could. The captured Miranda, meanwhile, was left to languish in his prison cell in La Guaira until Monteverde transferred him to the more secure fort at Puerto Cabello, the very fort Bolívar had fatally lost back in July.",
            "Those who did manage to escape Monteverde’s clutches sought asylum in various foreign island colonies off the mainland. So British Trinidad and Tobago, or Aruba, and then most especially the Dutch island of Curaçao, which is just about 50 miles north of the Venezuelan coast. So not too far as the crow flies, but politically safe from Spanish royalist retribution.",
            "And I do want to insert a little terminology note here to distinguish the two sides in the battles to come in the rest of today’s episode. I will be using “royalist” as a tag for the enemies of Bolívar and his friends. But I do want you to remember that this means that there are partisans of the Regency, the Cádiz Cortes, and the liberal monarchy enshrined in the Constitution of 1812. Now, some of these royalists are unreconstructed conservatives who would welcome the return of the old Bourbon imperial regime. Monteverde is actually secretly one of those guys. But at the moment, Bolívar is fighting for independence from the liberal Cortes in Cádiz, not yet from the conservative court of King Ferdinand. That will come later.",
            "After securing a passport and sailing from La Guaira on August 27, 1812, Bolívar joined the band of Venezuelan exiles in Curaçao, many of them old friends, family, and neighbors, including an uncle named José Félix Ribas, who would become Bolívar’s chief lieutenant during the Admirable campaign.",
            "Upon arrival, though, the Dutch customs officials confiscated what baggage Bolívar carried with him until he could pay for his passage. But this turned out to be a problem because he was no longer the massively wealthy young man who had been able to buy his way into an ambassadorship to Britain. Bolívar learned from one of his sisters that Monteverde had confiscated all the family property—the mines, the estates, the businesses, everything. Bolívar could expect no money. He was now an indigent refugee. So that left him stranded in Curaçao for the next two months until he finally managed to secure a loan from a local merchant that he befriended. ",
            "During this period of forced idleness, Bolívar’s mind turned and turned and turned as he tried to make sense of what had happened and what he could possibly do next. And by the time he was preparing to leave Curaçao, he had pretty clearly worked out a plan of action. He was going to sail for Cartagena, which still enjoyed the independence Caracas had lost, and rally the New Granadans into a pan-American patriotic war of independence because only if they all worked together could they hope to win their collective freedom from Spain.",
            "So at the end of October 1812, Bolívar and a small band of loyal Venezuelan exiles sailed from Curaçao to Cartagena, and upon arrival, got about the business of planning their own personal reconquista.",
            "I purposely set aside talking about events in New Granada after that wave of Independence Day swept through South America that we talked about in Episode 5.8 because I knew that Bolívar’s arrival in Cartagena in November 1812 would be a really nice opportunity to play catch-up. So we’re going to play catch-up here, and I will try to keep this as straightforward as possible. But I do want to warn you that for the rest of today’s episode, there is going to be a quick succession of new names entering the picture, but really, there are only two big ones that you’re going to need to remember. I’ll tell you when we get to them. So mostly, I just want you to sit back and enjoy the ride.",
            "So we left New Granada in July of 1810, with the news of the fall of the Central Junta spreading from Cartagena up to Bogotá and triggering the formation of independent juntas in every city that the news reached. All of this culminated in July 1810 with the overthrow of the viceroy in Bogotá.",
            "Well, since then, New Granada has been enduring the same four-quadrant divisions that have plagued Venezuela. Remember, that’s the centralist-federalist axis on one hand, and the monarchist-republican axis on the other.",
            "In New Granada, the centralist republicans were pretty much all in Bogotá. As the capital of the viceroyalty of New Granada, the patriot leaders in Bogotá naturally assumed that Bogotá would become the capital of independent New Granada and exert the same level of authority once wielded by the viceroy. But all the other cities in New Granada were like, “Hell no.” They were all staunch republican federalists. They were interested in building a confederation of independent cities, not subordinating themselves to some Bogotá dictatorship. And that was just on the patriot republican side. In between and amongst them were monarchists and royalists, a mixture of unreconstructed conservative peninsulares and then more moderate liberals who wanted to remain in the fold of the empire. And then, of course, the mixed-race lower classes who were all justifiably concerned about the tyranny of independent criollos. And this would all lead to a very messy running conflict of everybody fighting against everybody else.",
            "So the way it played out specifically was that after the overthrow of the viceroy in Bogotá, the Bogotá Junta set about organizing what they thought was going to be a centralized government. They tried to do this all through 1810 and 1811 but found, to their dismay, that nobody else wanted to join.",
            "Instead, a radical patriot lawyer named Camilo Torres took the lead in organizing a rival federalist government that would be based in the city of Tunja. The centralists and federalists then vied for the loyalty of the other cities in New Granada, with the federalists in Tunja coming out way ahead because they were promising political autonomy for local municipal leaders, with a shared congress in Tunja acting as little more than a glorified summit of independent city-states. The centralists in Bogotá then watched in dismay as most of New Granada rejected their authority. And to try to right the ship, they turned to a man that we have not heard from since Episode 5.3 when he was arrested for translating and distributing the Declaration of the Rights of Man. You remember that guy, Antonio Nariño.",
            "If you will recall, after escaping from Spanish captivity, Nariño had gone back to New Granada. But upon concluding that his fellow New Granadans were not yet ready for independence, he turned himself into the viceroy in 1797, whereupon he then sat in a Cartagena prison off and on until the winds of independence came sweeping through in 1810.",
            "Well, here we are. Freed from his cell, Nariño returned to Bogotá, where he was venerated as an early martyr for the patriotic cause. As brilliant and passionate as ever, Nariño was elected president of the centralist government in Bogotá in 1811, and his core mission was to bring Camilo Torres and the Tunja government to heel and make Bogotá the true capital of New Granada. But spoiler alert, Nariño is not going to succeed.",
            "So in March of 1812, that is just as the Caracas earthquake was dooming the first Venezuelan republic, President Nariño dispatched a small army to go subdue the federalists in Tunja and bring it under Bogotá’s authority, but as soon as this army got to Tunja, the general entrusted with the job switched sides and declared for the federalists. Pretty soon, that army Nariño had sent had turned around and was marching back towards Bogotá, forcing the centralists to scramble a defense. And this little patriotic civil war was, of course, very bad for the larger republican cause because royalist forces, those still loyal to God and the King, took advantage of the situation. And as we’ll see in a moment, for example, pretty much the entire length of the Magdalena River was soon held by royalists, cutting off all communication between the ports along the coast and the interior cities. It was into this very messy political and military situation that Bolívar and his friends arrived in Cartagena in November 1812.",
            "Now, to add one further wrinkle to all this, because Cartagena was at the moment pretty much cut off from the interior, they weren’t linked to neither the centralists in Bogotá nor the federalists in Tunja. They were essentially their own little city-state at the moment. And it was to the government of Cartagena that Bolívar and his friends presented themselves and said, “What can we do to help you?” These exiled Venezuelans were warmly received by the civilian Cartagena government but much less so by the officer currently running Cartagena’s small military force. That man was a French adventurer named Pierre Labatut. Labatut had been a sergeant in Napoleon’s imperial army and had served in the opening stages of the Peninsular War but had then left service and become a pirate operating in the Caribbean. Labatut actually led a fairly interesting life. When he heard that Venezuela had declared its independence, Labatut then went down and offered his services to General Miranda and the First Republic as a mercenary. Now, generally speaking, Miranda did not like Frenchmen, but in short order, Labatut became one of Miranda’s favorite officers, probably for no other reason than Labatut at least knew something about proper European soldiering.",
            "When the First Republic fell, Labatut made his escape from Venezuela courtesy of the United States Navy. He finagled himself a spot on the USS Matilda that spirited him directly to Cartagena without the months of purgatory in Curaçao. Thanks to his high rank in the Venezuelan army, his European war experience, and close connections to General Miranda, the Cartagena government made Labatut Commander in Chief of their armed forces in the summer of 1812. And so, he had been on the job for just a few months when the Venezuelans arrived in November, and Labatut wanted no part of them. He knew Bolívar’s reputation well, that he was a cocky hothead who would allow Puerto Cabello to fall and then betrayed Miranda. So when the Cartagena government ordered Labatut to find a place for Bolívar in the Cartagena army, Labatut said, “Fine,” and appointed Colonel Bolívar to lead 70 men in Barranco Vieja, a strategically insignificant town that lay on the lower banks of the great Magdalena River. There, Bolívar was supposed to sit and not get in Labatut’s way.",
            "But Bolívar had no intention of just sitting around. He had reflected on his experiences fighting a losing war for the First Republic. And above all, had learned one big lesson in military strategy: that cautious defense is a strategy for losers. Miranda had sat back on his heels and refused to take the fight to the enemy. And as a result, he had lost the war. Bolívar was now convinced that fast-paced, aggressive campaigns were the only way to go. They would keep the enemy surprised and off-balance. And from here on out, Bolívar would never play defense. He would always play offense. And if George Washington’s signature move was the coordinated retreat, Bolívar was the lightning, bordering on reckless, offense. And he is about to launch a doozy of a lightning offensive that will, for the first time, make people stand up and take notice of the name Bolívar.",
            "But Bolívar’s reflections on the fall of the First Republic resulted not just in military lessons learned, but also political lessons learned. And his months spent in purgatory in Curaçao had afforded him time to work out a systematic analysis of what had gone wrong and what must be done to make it right. And on December 15, 1812, just before he left to take up his post in Barranco Vieja, Bolívar published an open letter to the residents of Cartagena that has since become one of the core Bolivarian texts. It is known as the Cartagena Manifesto.",
            "The Cartagena Manifesto was an open letter in two parts. The first part spelled out why he thought the first Venezuelan republic had failed. And the second part spelled out what the New Granadans should and should not do if they wanted to avoid the fate of unhappy Venezuela.",
            "Bolívar highlighted a number of factors: the lack of political unity, the lack of military resolve. He thought the leaders of the Republic entirely too lenient towards enemies of the state. He thought the reliance on temporary militias rather than building a real professional army had doomed them all on the battlefield. But nothing did he single out more than the federalist structure of the Constitution. He said that the Spanish Americans were ill-suited for federalism because their centuries under absolutist rule had failed to give them the habits and virtues of true republican citizens. That emerging states needed a strong central government or they would fail. And even more particularly, he thought the Venezuelan constitution, with its emphasis on decentralized government and individual rights, was a document made for a time of peace, not of war—and they were at war.",
            "He summed this all up by saying, ",
            "“From the foregoing, it is clear that among the causes leading to the fall of Venezuela, first was the nature of her Constitution, which was, I repeat, as inimical to her interests as it was favorable to those of her enemies. Second was the spirit of misanthropy that took hold of our governors. Third was the opposition to the establishment of a standing army that could have saved the republic and warded off the blows dealt by the Spaniards. Fourth was the earthquake, accompanied by the fanaticism that gave such dire interpretations to this event. And finally, were the internal factions that were, in reality, the mortal poison that pushed the country into her grave.”",
            "He then moved on to what needed to be done. And in Bolívar’s estimation, there was no question what needed to be done: Beyond obvious need to unify and centralize and work together, the New Granadans needed to help him undertake the reconquest of Venezuela, which was at present poised to act as the beachhead for all Spanish political and military action on the continent. Having already commented in the Cartagena manifesto about the failure of Caracas to subdue Coro, allowing it to become a fortified base for the royalist invasion, he now said that Venezuela threatened to become the Coro of the whole of South America. He said literally, “Applying the example of Venezuela to New Granada and expressing it algebraically, we could say that Coro is to Caracas what Caracas is to all America.” So if the New Granadans wanted to maintain their freedom, they needed to look beyond their own parochial concerns and help him expel the Spanish from Venezuela. Or surely the Spanish would soon be coming from Venezuela to extinguish the liberty in New Granada.",
            "Bolívar wrapped up the Cartagena Manifesto by saying, ",
            "“The honor of New Granada absolutely demands we teach these audacious invaders a lesson, pursuing them to their last strongholds. Since our own glory requires that we undertake the campaign against Venezuela to liberate the cradle of Colombian independence. The martyrs and worthy people of Caracas, whose cries are addressed only to their beloved compatriots the Granadans, whom they await with mortal impatience as their redeemers. Let us march forth to break the chains of those victims groaning in dungeons still awaiting salvation from us. Do not betray their trust. Do not be deaf to the pleas of our brothers. Rush forth to avenge death, to give life to the dying, succor to the oppressed, and freedom to all.”",
            "The Cartagena Manifesto has entered the pantheon of Bolivarian texts, along with the letter from Jamaica and a few others, as one of the principal statements of Bolívar’s emerging worldview. And most of the things that he highlights in the Cartagena Manifesto—the need for a strong central government, his skepticism that Spanish Americans are ready for the kind of enlightened liberalism of the United States and Britain, the need for a professional army rather than part-time militias —these would all be drums that he would beat constantly for the rest of his life, even as that beat ultimately carried him into a depressed and bitter exile. ",
            "But that is still quite a ways off, and when Bolívar arrived in Barranco Vieja, he was still young and bursting with reckless energy, and he had no intention of following Labatut’s order to sit and do nothing. The royalists held the entire stretch of the upper Magdalena River, really everything south of Barranco Vieja, and Bolívar planned to do something about it. After acquiring ten large riverboats and recruiting additional men to bulk up his forces, Bolívar and 200 men, launched themselves up the river on December 21, 1812, beginning what would become known to history as the Magdalena Campaign.",
            "The first target was the small town of Tenerife, where 500 royalist troops occupied an armed camp. These royalists were so surprised when Bolívar’s men came whipping around a bend in the river, guns blazing, that they just scattered to the winds, leaving behind a cache of guns, and ammo, and supplies. Bolívar loaded up everything onto his boat and ordered his men to keep moving. ",
            "Their next destination was the city of Mompox, which was actually held by republicans who had been isolated by the surrounding royalist forces. The people of Mompox were thrilled to see Bolívar’s force arrive, and the residents of the city outfitted him even further. And then he recruited 300 more men to his cause, bringing Bolívar’s little army up to about 500.",
            "Setting out from Mompox, Bolívar then charged up the river, clearing out all royalist units he came across with relentless speed and aggression. And this was not an easy push—the water was filled with crocodiles, the land was filled with snakes, it was all swampy and overgrown, it was humid, difficult terrain. But captured royalist camps brought him even more guns and ammunition, while estates run by friendly republicans offered him provisions and assistance. But Bolívar never stopped moving, and the pace and ferocity of the campaign turned in an extraordinary result. By January 8, 1813, just 15 days after setting out, Bolívar and his men had traveled 300 miles up the Magdalena River and cleared the entire stretch of royalist troops.",
            "The capstone of the campaign came just a few days later when he moved off the river to capture the city of Ocaña, near the border with Venezuela. And yes, there is a map of these campaigns at revolutionspodcast.com.",
            "The Magdalena Campaign put Simón Bolívar on the map. Until now, he had been a fairly anonymous and inconsequential young man. He enjoyed some local infamy in Caracas as a barely tolerated radical, easily dismissed by more serious leaders. I mean, who knows how many people even bothered to read the Cartagena Manifesto when it was first published. But after the Magdalena Campaign, the name Bolívar was on the tip of everyone’s tongue. “My God, look at what this man has done now.”",
            "Pierre Labatut was incensed when he found out about the unauthorized offensive and demanded that Bolívar be court-martialed. But the Cartagena government said, “Ha ha, yeah, right,” and ordered Bolívar to go link up with a small force manning the borderlands between New Granada and Venezuela. Because there were reports that Monteverde was planning an invasion of New Granada, and troop buildups in western Venezuela seemed to confirm those reports.",
            "But in what would become a recurring problem for Bolívar, the enthusiasm of the men who had fought their way up the Magdalena River was now spent. They had done their duty and now wanted to go home. So Bolívar was forced to go find new recruits. So, in February 1813, he traveled back to Mompox, where he was now a famous hero, and raised 400 new men. Then he turned around and marched those guys up into the mountainous borderlands between New Granada and Venezuela. And the change in terrain during the wars of Spanish American independence is pretty remarkable. After coming up the swampy and humid Magdalena River, Bolívar and his men now crossed wide-open mountain plains, cold and dry and windswept, and mostly devoid of inhabitants. ",
            "As they advanced on the border city of Cúcuta from the northwest, Bolívar and company spied a royalist force that had indeed advanced into New Granada from Venezuela, and they were now occupying a critical mountain pass. To dislodge these guys, Bolívar sent up a spy carrying a letter about a fake republican army advancing from the south, an easy army for the royalists to pounce on. When the spy was captured, the royalist commander read the letter and thought, “Aha! I have a chance to get the drop on my enemies.” And he moved out of the pass to attack. But as soon as he moved, Bolívar’s forces, the real forces in the region, snuck up behind and pounced on the royalist rear, sending them running headlong back to the city of Cúcuta. ",
            "Bolívar’s company then linked up with that other Patriot unit. And on February 28th, they all launched an attack on Cúcuta. Despite being outnumbered two to one, the patriot forces charged in and took the royalists by surprise. And it was not just the timing that surprised the royalists, but also the ferocity of the attack. The turning point in the battle came when José Félix Ribas led a bayonet charge uphill against a superior force, which is pretty much the opposite of what you’re ever supposed to do. And he was awarded for his audacity when the royalists panicked, broke, and fled back across the border into Venezuela. The victory at Cúcuta pretty much ended any invasion threat posed by Monteverde, and all the patriots in New Granada, centralist and federalist, both could breathe a little easier. And as a reward for his service, Bolívar was promoted to Brigadier General.",
            "By the time Bolivar was reporting these victories, the civil war between the centralists and federalists was winding down, with the Bogotá centralists recognizing that they were never going to be able to impose their authority on the rest of the country. And pretty soon, the rival presidents, Torres and Nariño, agreed to form a Union of New Granada under a federalist structure. Nariño himself would transition from being a President to a General, and by June 1813, he would be leading a republican army southwest in the direction of Quito, hoping to liberate that city from the royalist occupation they had been enduring since 1809.",
            "Bolívar, meanwhile, now wanted to take his army east into Venezuela, and he sent his uncle, José Félix Ribas, to confer with the New Granadan leadership in Tunja to make them sanction this invasion of Venezuela. Caracas must not become Coro. It took some cajoling, but finally, the New Granadan leadership agreed to sanction Bolívar’s invasion, but he was only supposed to go as far as the city of Trujillo, which was not quite halfway between Cúcuta and Caracas. This was good enough for Bolívar, though, and he prepared to march.",
            "But most of the New Granadan soldiers under his command were not super interested in transitioning from a defensive New Granada to an invasion of Venezuela. Indeed, the New Granadan Colonel that Bolívar had been working alongside hated the idea so much that when official permission to invade Venezuela came on May 7, 1813, the Colonel and 100 of his men resigned on the spot. So that left what was left of that company under the command of a man Bolívar would come to have a long and tumultuous partnership with. And as I said, there would be two men introduced in today’s episode that you actually need to pay attention to, and this is one of them: Francisco de Paola Santander, the man of laws. ",
            "Santander was, at this point, a young man. He had been born in April 1792, so he was just approaching his 21st birthday when he met Bolívar for the first time. Santander was actually born in Cúcuta to a respectable criollo family that grew cocoa, and his father was also a respected provincial administrator. Young Santander got a good elite education and then went off to Bogotá to study law and was in the capital city as a promising 18-year-old law student when the viceroy was overthrown in July 1810. An enthusiastic patriot, Santander joined the republican army in Bogotá and wound up serving as secretary to that first General that President Nariño sent against the federalists in March 1818, the general who immediately switched sides. While Santander had no problem following his boss over to the federalists because his political philosophy leaned heavily in the direction of federalism. And that philosophy would forever put him at odds with Bolívar, even as the two men worked side by side on the project of liberating South America and creating Gran Colombia. Santander would also come to embody the belief that civilian authority and the rule of law were superior to the kind of military dictatorships that Bolívar would soon come to embody. The partnership and rivalry between Bolívar and Santander will be a defining feature of the story of Gran Colombia. And it is here in the spring of 1813 that they had their first confrontation.",
            "So, though he elected to stay in the army, Santander was not enthusiastic about the invasion of Venezuela, and he dragged his feet releasing his men to Bolívar’s command. It got to the point where Bolívar was shouting at Santander, “March at once. You have no choice in the matter. March. Either you shoot me or by God, I will certainly shoot you.” Now, Santander himself did not march. He stayed to administer Cúcuta, but he did release his men to Bolívar’s authority. And so, on May 23, 1813, Bolívar crossed the border into Venezuela, beginning what has become known as the Admirable campaign, which is an unintentionally ironic name, to be sure. ",
            "Now, General Bolívar only led about 500 men across the border, headed in the direction of Mérida. But as he approached, the royalists holding the city got scared and ran away. It was a bit like how Pompey fled Rome when he heard Caesar had crossed the Rubicon. The assumption was that if the enemy was invading, it must be like a huge army, not like 500 bedraggled soldiers led by some fanatic. So Bolívar entered Mérida without firing a shot, and the cheering residents of the city were the first to assign him the honorific that would become synonymous with his name forever: el Libertador, the Liberator.",
            "While he was in Mérida, Bolívar also recruited 600 more men, bringing his total numbers up to about 1,000 as he set off towards Trujillo. And while his patriotic army marched, they did not hold back their wrath against royalists and peninsulares that they ran into along the way. At all. The men who had been recently recruited into Bolívar’s forces had lived for the past year under Monteverde’s retaliatory authoritarianism, and now they wanted revenge. But the men who really wanted revenge was that small corps of officers who had traveled with Bolívar from Curaçao to Cartagena and up the Magdalena River and into Venezuela again. They wanted the blood of their enemies to quench their thirst for vengeance. A 150-man company, led by one of Bolívar’s old neighbors, went out on a wide patrol that turned out to be more of a hunting expedition than anything else. They killed and maimed and tortured anyone they decided was the enemy. Bolívar knew that this was going on, but he did nothing to stop it and decided that the psychological terror it invoked was too useful to rein in. And he wasn’t exactly wrong. When his main army approached Trujillo, the royalists just abandoned the town. Bolívar was now nearly halfway to Caracas, and he had yet to even fight a battle. So the exaggerated fear of his army was doing the work for him. ",
            "Now, technically, Trujillo was supposed to be the end of the line. I mean, that was as far as he had been authorized to go. But Bolívar is obviously not going to worry about a little thing like orders from New Granada. He was on a mission to liberate Venezuela, all of Venezuela, and he planned to see it through. But what’s interesting here is that Bolívar’s mission was not just the liberation of Venezuela, it was now that he be the man to liberate Venezuela. Like Miranda before him, Bolívar dreamed of being the liberating savior of Venezuela. So when he arrived in Trujillo and was deciding, “Do I stay or do I keep going?” He learned that he might have strong competition on the Liberator front because while Bolívar was invading western Venezuela, eastern Venezuela was being engulfed by a mass patriot uprising. An uprising led by the second guy you really need to pay attention to today because he’s really super important: Santiago Mariño.",
            "Santiago Mariño was a rich criollo, born and raised in the eastern part of Venezuela, and he was a strong supporter of independence, going back to the first coup of April 10. He was also, in fact, a high-ranking revolutionary Freemason. He joined the Republican Army at the rank of Colonel. And after Miranda surrendered in July 1812, Mariño had fled the country, though he did not go to Curaçao but instead to British Trinidad, where his family owned some property and he had personal connections. Mariño then sat and stewed for a few months. But as reports filtered back up to him about all the terms of the peace that Monteverde was breaking, Mariño got agitated to the point where he could take it no more. So he gathered a small band of 45 hardcore patriot exiles in January 1813, this was just as Bolívar was finishing the Magdalena campaign, and they all sailed back down to Venezuela to restart the war in the east. This small corps of 45 men had among them a few of the leaders who would become the principal leaders in the coming wars, including José Francisco Bermúdez, but even more importantly, the mixed-race General Manuel Piar. And if there’s a third name you remember today, it should probably be Manuel Piar.",
            "So Santiago Mariño and the 45 men who came with him found eastern Venezuela all but devoid of royalist troops, as Monteverde had not unwisely arrayed all his forces in a double line facing New Granada. I mean, those troops were initially put in place in preparation for an invasion of New Granada, but now they were there to block Bolívar’s invasion from New Granada. So that left Mariño and his guys free to recruit and stir up patriotic fervor in the east. And they found the region very receptive to this lobbying and, most importantly, to the long-term project of independence, Santiago Mourinho was the first to convince black and mixed-race men to join his army, really for the first time, convincing them that life would be better under an independent republic than under the thumb of royalist peninsulares. By the time Bolívar was crossing into Venezuela in May, Mariño had gone from leading 45 men to close to 5,000, with loyal armed men in every town in the east and a huge central army readying itself to march on Caracas.",
            "Believing that the time to act was now, because he needed to beat Mariño to Caracas, on June 15, 1813, Bolívar issued the most infamous declaration of his career, one of the most infamous declarations in the entire history of the wars of Spanish American independence. The Decree of War to the Death. And because this decree is not too long, I’m just going to go ahead and read it in full:",
            "“Venezuelans, An army of brothers sent by the supreme congress of New Granada has come to liberate you, and it now stands among you after having expelled the oppressors from the provinces of Mérida and Trujillo. We are sent to destroy the Spaniards, to protect Americans, and to reestablish the republican governments that form the federation of Venezuela. The states protected by our arms are once again ruled by their former constitutions and leaders in the full enjoyment of their freedom and independence. Because our sole mission is to break the chains of servitude that still oppress some of our people, not to make laws or seize power, as the rules of war might authorize us to do. Moved by your misfortunes, we could not witness with indifference the afflictions visited upon you by the savage Spaniards who have annihilated and destroyed you with pillage and death, who have violated the sanctity of human rights, rendered null the most solemn articles of our surrender and treaty, and committed every imaginable crime, reducing Venezuela to the most horrific desolation. Thus, justice demands retribution, and necessity obliges us to take it. Let the monsters who have infested Colombian soil, covered it with blood, vanish forever. Let their punishment be equal to the enormity of their perfidy, thus washing away the stain of our ignominy and demonstrating to the nations of the world that one cannot offend the sons of America with impunity. Despite our resentment against the foul Spaniards, our generous hearts still see fit, one last time, to open the way to reconciliation and friendship. We invite them once again to live peacefully among us under the condition that, renouncing their crimes and acting henceforth in good faith, they cooperate with us in the destruction of the Spanish government of occupation and in the reestablishment of the Venezuelan republic. Any Spaniard who does not join our fight against tyranny to further this just cause actively and effectively will be regarded as an enemy and punished as a traitor to the country and consequently put to death without appeal. On the other hand, a general and absolute pardon is hereby granted to those who come over to our armies, with or without their weapons and who lend their support to the good citizens who are struggling to shake off the yoke of tyranny. Military officers and civil leaders who join us in proclaiming the government of Venezuela will keep their rank and offices. In a word, Spaniards who render distinguished service to the state will be regarded and treated as Americans. And you Americans who have been led from the path of justice by error and perfidy, be sure that your brothers forgive you and sincerely lament your offenses, convinced in our hearts that you cannot be to blame, that only the blindness and ignorance in which you have been held hitherto by the instigators of your crimes could have led you to commit them. Do not fear the sword that comes to avenge you and sever the ignominious bonds that bind you to the fate of your executioners. You may count on absolute immunity regarding your honor, your lives, and your property. The mere title of Americans will be your guarantee and your safeguard. Our weapons are here to protect you and will never be turned against a single one of our brothers.This amnesty extends even to the traitors who have most recently committed acts of felony. And it will be so religiously fulfilled that no reason, cause, or pretext will be sufficient to cause us to break our promise, no matter how grievous and extraordinary the motives you give us to arouse our loathing. Spaniards and Canarians, even if you profess neutrality, know that you will die unless you work actively to bring about the freedom of America. Americans, know that you will live even if you are guilty.Simón BolívarTrujillo General Headquarters, June 15, 1813.”",
            "Now, it might not be apparent at first blush, but what Bolívar is proposing here is the abandonment of the traditional rules of war. He is promising summary execution to Spaniards and Canary Islanders who are not just caught under arms or helping the royalist cause, which would on its own be a war crime. He’s talking about death for anyone who even tries to stay neutral. And this was not an empty threat. From here on out, Bolívar’s forces will indeed wage a war to the death. ",
            "But also in there is that promise to protect Americans, that no matter what, they would be treated leniently. So Bolívar’s ruthless orders are designed most especially to plant the idea that Americans, as Americans, are the only legitimate members of the body politic. Anyone from across the Atlantic could only justify their continued existence by unqualified service to the patriot cause.",
            "Bolívar’s Decree of War to the Death had its intended effect as inhabitants in any region he passed through flocked to his banner rather than be accused of neutrality, a crime now punishable by instant death. Soon Bolívar’s army would be up to 1,500, and he would be welcomed with open, desperately open arms wherever he went. But the Decree of War to the Death also opened the door for Bolívar’s royalist enemies to feel free to answer in kind. And the next phase of the Venezuelan War of Independence would be bitter, bloody, and to the death because out in the grasslands, the Legions of Hell are already forming.",
            "After issuing the Decree of War to the Death, Bolívar’s army then advanced on two fronts: a small advanced unit under José Félix Ribas and a main column under Bolívar himself. And the terrain changed again as the patriot armies descended from the mountains down into the flat grasslands. Monteverde’s forces tried desperately to set up a defensive line, but Bolívar’s double-time advance shredded their plans. When Bolívar’s men departed Trujillo, there were something like 5,000 royalist soldiers standing between him and Caracas, and after just a week and a half of running skirmishes, almost all of them had been killed, captured, or defected to the patriot cause. Now, momentum is an overused cliché most of the time, but right now Bolívar has all the momentum in the world.",
            "The decisive battle of the Admirable Campaign came at the end of July outside of Valencia near the spot where Bolívar had first seen military action. Monteverde had come out of Caracas to lead the royalists personally, but he could now only muster 1,200 men against Bolívar’s 1,500. And with all the momentum on their side, Bolívar’s forces smashed the royalists and sent them flying in every direction. Monteverde himself did not even waste time running back to Caracas. He fled all the way to the fortified port of Puerto Cabello, and once there, one of the first things he did was order Miranda be dragged out of his cell and dumped onto a boat to Puerto Rico so that the old precursor could not be saved.",
            "On August 6, 1813, Simón Bolívar approached Caracas, and his small army was greeted by a delegation from the city, including that old family friend who had given Bolívar asylum, and secured the passport that had made all of this possible. There was also a contingent of young women who greeted him in pristine white dresses. And when Bolívar entered the city at the head of a procession, it resembled nothing so much as a Roman triumph.",
            "Bolívar had set out from Barranco Vieja on December 21, 1812, and in seven and a half months of campaigning, he had traveled over 1,200 miles. Just to get a handle on what that means, he basically marched from New York City to Kansas City. Less than a year after setting sail from the wreckage of the First Republic, Bolívar had returned to Caracas and now stood poised to found the Second Republic."

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "In August 1813, Simón Bolívar had done the impossible. Less than one year earlier, he had been a miserable exile in Curaçao without any rational hope of a happy ending to his life. But instead of giving up, he instead imagined himself marching triumphantly back into Venezuela at the head of a patriotic army, clearing out the Spaniards and the royalists on his way to the glorious liberation of Caracas.",
            "And then he had done it. In less than a year, he had done it. He had gone from stone-broke exile to conquering hero. Naturally, his status in Caracas skyrocketed from what it had been the last time that he was there. Remember, he had always been kept at arm’s length by the cooler and wiser heads of the city. He had served in neither the Caracas Junta nor the first Venezuelan Congress. And the only way he got that ambassadorship to Britain was by paying for the trip.",
            "When he joined the army of the First Republic, he was commissioned as a mere Colonel and purposefully kept away from the center of the action by Miranda. But now he was the general, the Liberator, and no one could keep him at arm’s length anymore because wherever Bolívar was, that was now the center of the action. And he had gone from tolerated radical to de facto dictator of Venezuela.",
            "Now, if you’ll remember from my reading of the Decree of War to the Death, though, a lot of people took Bolívar at his word when he said, “we are sent to destroy the Spaniards, to protect Americans, and to reestablish the republican governments that form the Federation of Venezuela. The states protected by our arms are once again ruled by their former constitutions and leaders.” So it’s not at all surprising that a lot of people in Venezuela expected the Liberator to reinstate the first Venezuelan constitution in all of its federalist glory. But there was no chance that Bolívar was going to do that. When the reinstated republican governor of the province of Barinas requested the restoration of the constitution, Bolívar said, “No, Venezuela is now ruled from Caracas. The lack of political unity is what got us into this mess, and I am not going to make that same mistake again.”",
            "And Bolívar was not just talking about a unified Venezuela here because no sooner had he arrived in Caracas that he was talking up his vision for joining with New Granada to form a single unified superstate. And this was going to be a long, hard sales pitch that Bolívar would make for the rest of his life, and that nobody would ever really buy. But he would keep making that pitch until the day they finally ran him out of Bogotá for good in 1830.",
            "But though Bolívar could dictate terms to the governor of Barinas and the other provinces of western Venezuela, after all, he had liberated them all and commanded the armies of the west, he could not just dictate terms to the provinces of eastern Venezuela. Those provinces were garrisoned by the armies of Santiago Mariño, and so in the east, it was Mariño’s word that was law, not Bolívar’s. Mariño made it clear that he expected his territories to be independent states within a federalist system. And though Bolívar rejected the idea, there was nothing he could really do to force his centralist vision on Mariño. It’s not like Bolívar could march east and take Mariño down, nor did he really want to. It would have been massively counterproductive. So as the Second Republic got off the ground in the late summer of 1813, the west would be run by Bolivar and the east by Mariño.",
            "Now, if you were going to draw a map of Venezuela in the summer of 1813, things would have looked very favorable for the Second Venezuelan Republic. There was a division between Bolívar and Mariño, yes. But their common enemy, the royalists, had been pushed back to a few isolated enclaves, mostly along the coast, and then in the deep southeast along the Orinoco River. Domingo de Monteverde had shut himself up in Puerto Cabello and refused all offers to come to terms. Further west, the city of Coro continued to be a well-defended base of royalist operations. And it was currently under the command of a Spanish field marshal named Juan Manuel Cajigal, who had taken over for the guy who was supposed to have become Captain General after the fall of the First Republic, a guy named Fernando Miyares.",
            "Now, I mentioned Miyares very briefly two episodes back, but then we just stopped talking about him because it turns out the guy had no backbone. When Monteverde essentially struck out on his own to go conquer Caracas, Miyares made a few feeble attempts to exert authority and then said, “Oh, well, it’s fine,” and he sailed back to Puerto Rico, never to return. Monteverde never did have any official sanction for his campaign or the year he’s now spent as de facto dictator of Venezuela. He had just done it all and dared anybody to tell him not to, though in the end, it turned out not to be Spanish authorities who told him not to, but rather Simón Bolívar.",
            "Now, with things looking pretty good on paper, the now 30-year-old Bolívar established himself in Caracas as a self-proclaimed emergency dictator. He would eventually get around to calling for a representative government to be formed, but for the moment, he was in no great hurry. And in the absence of a functioning constitution or government, Bolívar just ruled.",
            "But though he had a pretty good idea of how to avoid the mistakes of the First Republic, Bolivar was quickly confronted with a dilemma that would allow him to make all new mistakes. So the men and women of the leading families of Caracas came by almost daily to make sure that Bolívar was not planning to turn the world upside down, that the rebellious slaves would all be returned to work, that the uppity pardos would be put back in their place. They wanted him to divert military resources to slave-hunting patrols so that they could all get their haciendas back up and running.",
            "Now, as I said, Bolívar was not and never was a true believer in big white supremacy. But at this point, it seemed more important to him to consolidate support amongst the elite criollo than the lower-class pardos. And this would be a major mistake because the majority of the Venezuelan population, as we’ve said, was not white. And Bolívar did not yet recognize that until the criollos got over themselves, that the republican project was doomed to failure. And his failure to recognize this fact, to mostly go along with what his old friends and neighbors wanted, was the new mistake that would doom the Second Republic.",
            "So that brings us to the men who would prove to be the decisive factor, not just in this early stage of the wars of Venezuelan independence, but at every stage of the wars of Venezuelan independence. Had the conflict remained one that pitted Bolívar and Mariño’s republican forces against the few remaining royalist forces led by Monteverde and Cajigal, I have little doubt that the Second Republic would have survived quite a bit longer than it did. But it did not. And that is because down in the wide-open grasslands that covered most of southern Venezuela, the cowboys of the Llanos were coalescing into gangs that would then merge to become larger bands, that would then merge to become whole armies. And from here on out, whichever side the llaneros are on, that side is going to win.",
            "So I briefly mentioned the Llanos when rolling through the topography of New Granada back in Episode 5.2, and I’ll actually just go ahead and quote myself here to remind you. I said, “The region between the coast and the Orinoco, for example, was just huge stretches of worthless grassland dubbed the Llanos, run through with riverbeds that are flooded out between May and October and bone dry from November to April. The whole swath of territory is filled with roughly one gillion bugs, but no precious metal.” ",
            "And then when talking about the economics of Venezuela, I said, “Out in those worthless Venezuelan grasslands, cattle and horses introduced during the early days now roamed in wild herds, and a population of mostly mixed-race cowboys had moved in to make a go of it in hides and meat.” And those cowboys are going to be really super duper majorly important, so don’t forget about them.",
            "Well, I hope you didn’t forget about them because here we are. The cowboys of the Llanos, called the llaneros, roamed the vast plains that stretched to the Brazilian border by the tens of thousands. Many of them had come to this location as vagabonds and hard cases and free spirits who had gone off to escape the rigid social structures of the civilized urban areas. And the Llanos was where the racial caste system was barely acknowledged as practically all llaneros were some version of non-white. They were black or Indian, mestizo, pardo, sambo. Now the owners of the big ranches were, of course, criollo, but these guys were almost uniformly absentee owners, leaving the management of the lands and herds to black, pardo, and mestizo managers. And if anything, out in the Llanos, pure whites were looked down on as soft and weak because the llaneros were a hardy breed who took pride in their ability to endure any hardship. They rode from sun up to sundown. They rode when it was a million degrees and everything was dust and dehydration. They rode when it did nothing but rain for months on end and the entire landscape was flooded out. They endured the bugs. They slept on the ground. The grasslands were not completely lawless, but it was a far more Darwinian existence than in the cities. The weak could not hack it. Only the strong survived. And these cowboys, the llaneros, would prove to be the men who held the fate of Venezuela in their hands.",
            "Now, during the early days of the First and Second Republic, I think it’s fair to say that the llaneros didn’t have much in the way of political consciousness, and most did not ride off into battle in defense of some well-thought-out political agenda. They were not like proto-Zapatistas, the peasant soldiers of the Mexican Revolution, who fought specifically for concrete political and economic reforms. Mostly, it was the promise of plunder and riches and adventure that earned the fluid allegiance of the llaneros. But though it’s fair to say that they did not have revolutionary consciousness, they were still a revolutionary force. I mean, once you have huge armies of mixed-race cavalry riding around who hated the criollos and wanted to humiliate them, kill them, and then take their stuff, I mean, even if it was just greed driving them, all that killing and plundering would have the effect of turning the world upside down.",
            "The first man to recognize the military and political might of the llaneros was, ironically enough, a peninsular, a particularly ruthless peninsular named José Tomás Boves. Boves had been born in northern Spain in 1782, so he’s just about 30 years old at this point and just nine months older than Bolívar. As a teenager, Boves became a pilot, serving on merchant ships that traded between Spain and the Americas. But at some point, and it’s not clear to me when, he got busted in Venezuela for smuggling, and the authorities tossed him into prison. He secured his release only by agreeing to go into exile out into the Llanos. And so he moved down to the small interior city of Calabozo. There he reinvented himself as a merchant and cattle rancher. A charismatic and imposing man with a famously huge head, Boves soon became a leading fixture of Calabozo.",
            "Now, he had tried to join the army of the First Republic, but his request for a command had been rejected by the stuck-up criollos of Caracas. And shortly thereafter, under murky circumstances, he was arrested for treason and tossed in jail, and he was actually slated to be executed. But in May of 1812, Monteverde’s army had swept through and freed him. Boves then joined Monteverde’s army and was rewarded for his service in January 1813 when he was appointed administrator of Calabozo. ",
            "But, of course, January 1813 is right when Bolívar was wrapping up the Magdalena campaign and Santiago Mariño was reinvading eastern Venezuela with his 45 true believers. Soon the tide would turn against Monteverde’s royalist regime. But Bolívar’s admirable campaign did not come through Calabozo, nor did Mariño’s forces yet penetrate that far west. So all on his own, Boves began to form a legion of llaneros to fight the forces of the Second Republic. ",
            "But Boves and his guys were royalists in name only. Boves kind of hated everybody equally at this point, and his recruitment pitch was about plunder and riches, not God and the King. But Boves himself now bore a special hatred for the aristocratic, racist, soft criollos that ran the Republic. And so when representatives from the Republic came around to begin the process of integrating all Venezuela under the rule of Caracas, Boves made it very clear that they were most unwelcome in Calabozo, and that if that little dandy Bolívar wants a war to the death, he’s going to get it.",
            "So by mid-September 1813, the Second Republic faced a war on two fronts: against the true royalist forces led by Monteverde and Cajigal, operating out of Puerto Cabello and Coro, respectively, and then Boves and his llaneros marauders, gathering around Calabozo, and already riding around on plundering expeditions. They sacked haciendas and estates and any town they came across. So after about an eight-week respite following the conclusion of the admirable campaign, Simón Bolívar went back to war.",
            "In mid-September, Monteverde was reinforced with 1,200 peninsular soldiers sent from Cádiz. And almost as soon as these troops landed, Monteverde staged a breakout from Puerto Cabello. He wanted to go capture Valencia, which lay just about 30 miles due south. Monteverde led 2,000 men out of Puerto Cabello at the end of September, but as they approached Valencia, a 3,000-man Republican army met them at Barbuda on September 30 and decisively blocked Monteverde’s advance. As the royalist forces fell back, the republicans pursued, and a couple of days later, on October 3, they fought a second battle at Las Trincheras, where Monteverde himself was severely wounded. The royalists then fell back all the way to Puerto Cabello in complete defeat. ",
            "This debacle convinced the Colonel, who had led the 1,200 reinforcements over from Spain, that the wounded Monteverde was no longer fit for command. So the Colonel took control of Puerto Cabello, and in short order, Monteverde would be getting on a boat to Puerto Rico and from that point be leaving our story entirely. He would remain in Puerto Rico until 1816 and then return permanently to Spain, where he would live until he died in 1832. His year as self-proclaimed dictator of Venezuela would never come back to haunt him because, as we’ll discuss next week, events in Spain were far too tumultuous for anybody to care about Monteverde. And if anything, his vigorous defense of Spanish rule in the Americas earned him accolades, not admonishments.",
            "So it was all sunshine and roses for the republicans on that front of the war. And this would be followed by good news on the other front. To deal with the marauding llaneros, Bolívar sent 2,500 men up to Calabozo under the command of a particularly ruthless character named Vicente Campo Elías. Like his opponent, Boves, Campo Elías was a peninsular. He had been a businessman in the city of Mérida when the revolutionary wave started crashing on Venezuelan shores. And despite being a full-blooded Spaniard, Campo Elías eagerly joined the patriot cause. He was prominent in the independent junta movement and suffered greatly when the First Republic fell as he was targeted for harassment by Monteverde’s agents.",
            "When Bolívar came through Mérida at the outset of the admirable campaign, Campo Elías joined up and took the lead in recruiting others to join Bolívar’s army. And Campo Elías would be one of the staunchest defenders of the war to the death because he was quite famously a Spaniard of the self-loathing variety, and he said that when he was finished killing every Spaniard in Venezuela, he was going to turn his sword on himself.",
            "On October 14, 1813, Campo Elías met Boves’s legion of llaneros outside Calabozo and routed them so decisively that as Boves fled the field, he took with him only 17 men. Campo Elías then took hundreds of prisoners and proceeded to execute every last one of them. And then, as he brought republican rule to Calabozo and the surrounding region, he was ruthless with anyone suspected of royalism. So atrocities committed by each side in these campaigns would soon justify the atrocities committed by the other side until the cycle of atrocities was spinning out of control. ",
            "The success of his subordinates against the royalists then induced Bolívar to go out and take personal command of the situation. And what he wanted to do was push west towards the city of Barquisimeto, which, if you draw a line west from republican-held Valencia and south from royalist-controlled Coro, that’s where Barquisimeto is. Bolívar wanted to ensure that all roads back to New Granada were secure, but Field Marshal Cajigal sent out an expedition from Coro to block this attempt. In mid-November, Bolívar was dealt his first defeat. The royalists were fairly well whipped during the battle, but in the attack, Bolívar’s infantry got confused and started to retreat, leaving the royalists free to attack the panicked republicans and drive them off with fairly heavy casualties. Bolívar was so pissed about all this that when the survivors reconvened, he screamed at them and said, “From here on out, you will be called the Nameless Brigade for the shame that you have brought to the patriot cause.” ",
            "But that was really the only low point for the whole rest of the year.",
            "Bolívar’s uncle, José Félix Ribas, the hero of the admirable campaign, soundly beat another attempted breakout from Puerto Cabello at the end of November, as both sides maneuvered around each other preparing for the biggest confrontation of the wars to date. That force from Puerto Cabello was supposed to be linking up with units coming down from Coro and an independent Llanero band coming out of the grasslands. But Ribas prevented this linkage, and after sending the royalists back to Puerto Cabello, he turned around to come reinforce Bolívar. The two sides finally squared off near the city of Araure on December 5, and I’ve seen estimates that put the numbers as high as 6,000 per side. But as far as I can tell, it was more like the low estimates of 2,000 infantry and about 1,000 cavalry apiece.",
            "Bolívar and the republicans won the Battle of Araure handily, with major contributions from the Nameless Brigade, who regained their honor and were then redubbed the Victors of Araure by their grateful General. ",
            "The Battle of Araure would prove to be the high point of the Second Republic if indeed it could be called a high point at all. Because, much like Miranda before him, Bolívar was not happy that this had descended into a civil war where Americans were fighting Americans. I mean, one of the whole points of the decree of war to the death was to prevent this kind of intra-American fighting. But when Bolívar and his generals looked across the lines, they saw native foreign Venezuelans fighting them to the death. The Second Republic, and at this point, we’re still talking about the personal military dictatorship of Simón Bolívar, had failed to convince the vast majority of the population that it was worth their allegiance. ",
            "Aware that his six months of authoritarian rule was probably eroding as much support for the Republic as it was building, Bolívar convened a public assembly at a church in Caracas on January 2, 1814, ostensibly to step down from office. He stood before the assembled crowd and said, “I am not your sovereign and was never meant to be. The time has come for you to elect a representative government.” He also said that though he was flattered by the title Liberator, the people of Venezuela should not forget that he was just one man and that the committed officers and common soldiers were the true liberators of Venezuela. ",
            "And this is something Bolívar is really good at. He was egotistical, sure, but he was not the guy who took all the credit and pretended like nobody else existed. For the whole run of his campaigns, Bolívar is always going to make sure that the men who did the work and the individual officers who had rendered some signal service were duly recognized. I mean, there is a reason he developed such a loyal following. And even here, as he is saying, “I want to resign as supreme commander,” and the people wrote, “No, you must stay.” Bolívar said, “There are more illustrious citizens than I. General Mariño, Liberator of the east, now there is a leader worthy of directing your destinies.” But the people wouldn’t hear of it, and despite his best efforts, they would not let Bolívar resign. Now, the likeliest explanation for this whole song and dance, of course, was that Bolívar wanted to shore up his dictatorship in a way that made it look like he was trying to give up his dictatorship. And the suggestion of Mariño was a calculated gambit to put on record the people’s rejection of Mariño. ",
            "With his rule effectively re-ratified, Bolívar returned to the war with renewed vigor, but he soon discovered that he was fighting a war against an enemy he could not defeat: demographics. He may be the darling of Caracas, but it seemed like everywhere else, friends of the Republic were few and far between. Practically the entire mixed-race population of Venezuela was openly siding with the royalists, the Decree of War to the Death or not. And out in the Llanos, the temporarily beaten José Tomás Boves had gone right back to recruiting, now more zealous than ever. On November 1, 1813, he had put out a general call to the cowboys to join him in a vast anti-white army of plunder. “Let’s kill those who hate us and take their stuff.” By January 1813, Boves had joined with another generous warlord named Tomás Morales, and their combined forces now numbered some 7,000. As they thundered around killing and plundering, they soon earned the name that would define them for all of history: the Legions of Hell. ",
            "Now, of those 7,000, only about 150 could be counted as white. So this really was shaping up now to be a full-blown race war. And there were just more non-whites in Venezuela than there were whites. The deep well of Llaneros, hankering for plunder and a chance to vent some wrath on the haughty criollos, would prove to be nearly inexhaustible. And at their peak, the Legions of Hell would number some 20,000. Meanwhile, Bolívar was now having major trouble recruiting to fill his own ranks. For every man the enemy lost, they could replace, no problem, sometimes with two or three more. For every man Bolívar lost, Bolívar lost to man. ",
            "And this was to say nothing of the problem of armaments. Bolívar had run the Magdalena campaign and the Admirable campaign basically with guns stolen from royalists along the way. Venezuela had no native arms factories. Everything had to now be purchased. So Bolívar begged and pleaded with the British to sell him guns. But they were still allied with the Spanish regency against Napoleon and refused to endanger that relationship. The United States, meanwhile, was continuing to stay as neutral as possible, and they would not officially sanction gun sales either. So Bolívar had to rely on infrequent black-market purchases. ",
            "Meanwhile, the royalists had no such problems. The forces down along the coast always had a lifeline of arms back through Spanish channels. And the llaneros of the interior – they didn’t even fight with guns. The signature weapon of the Legions of Hell was the sharpened lance. The men would hold these lances straight while hanging their whole bodies off to one side of the horse so you couldn’t get a good shot at them, and then they’d smash into you at full speed. The unprotected republican infantry trying to reload their early 19th-century guns would suffer atrocious casualties under these charges.",
            "So the war got going again in earnest in February 1814, and by then Bolívar was already well aware of his demographics problem and was begging Santiago Mariño to send him some reinforcements. But Mariño would drag his feet coming to Bolívar’s aid. He kept saying, “Yeah, yeah, I’ll send some guys.” But then he just didn’t. And Mariño almost waited too long.",
            "In early February, Boves and the Legions of Hell rode north and were planning to push their way into Caracas itself. But in order to pass from the grasslands into the valleys that would take them down to Caracas, they had to get through a sharp spine of low mountains. And the best place to do that was at a pass called La Puerta, which translates in this case as “the gate” or “the door.” Bolívar ordered good old Campo Elías to hold La Puerta, and Campo Elías got there just ahead of the Legions of Hell. But he only had 1,500 men with him and did not stand much of a chance. On February 3, 1814, the Legions crashed the gate, and after an intense fight, Campo Elías was forced to retreat, leaving 1,000 men dead in the field.",
            "With La Puerta cleared, Boves divided his men into three columns, which turned out to be not such a great idea because though the republicans couldn’t muster forces to take all of the legions at once, they could now pick off each column one by one. One of the three columns headed down to the town of La Victoria, where José Félix Ribas conscripted locals to fight for the Republic, including about 100 kids as young as twelve years old from a local school. And though they fought bravely, Ribas would have been overrun at La Victoria had not Campo Elías and the remnants of his army arrived just in the nick of time. ",
            "With La Victoria saved, Bolívar then ordered Ribas to go defend the city of Ocumare. But when Ribas got there, he found that the Legions of Hell under General Morales had already passed through. Ocumare was a body-strewn ghost town. ",
            "But Ribas did make a fortuitous discovery. General Morales had dropped a satchel full of letters, one of which made it clear that royalist prisoners in Caracas were planning a mass uprising. Ribas forwarded this intelligence to Bolívar, prompting Bolívar to make a very serious decision. He sent word to the man he had left in charge of Caracas. He said, “Without delay and without exception, you will put to the sword every Spaniard in the dungeon or hospital.” Between dungeon and hospital, that was about 1,000 men. And from February 14 to February 16, 1814, these thousand men were systematically corralled out onto a plain near the city and beheaded one by one. This was the black mark on Bolívar’s record I was talking about when we discussed Bolívar’s shame and having lost Puerto Cabello, how he did not want to make the mistake of letting prisoners get the drop on him again. And so he ordered this mass indiscriminate execution. War to the death.",
            "While Ribas had stymied the advance of one column of the Legions of Hell, Simón Bolívar was grappling with the rest and, against his instincts, was now forced into a defensive crouch. And as he was ordering the murder of all those prisoners, he was himself busy setting up what looked an awful lot like a last stand at one of his own estates in San Mateo. After leaving Ocumare, Ribas and Campo Elías joined Bolívar at the newly fortified estate at San Mateo. And when Boves launched a full frontal attack, on February 28, the republicans were able to successfully beat him off. ",
            "The whole month of March then turned into the siege of San Mateo, with Boves and the Legions of Hell unable to crack their way in. But Bolívar and the republicans running out of time, ammunition, and supplies. And then they got hit with the demoralizing news on March 17 when Campo Elías was killed in a skirmish.",
            "Boves then launched two more major attacks on March 20 and March 25 to try to break the siege. And on March 25th, he was nearly victorious. His guys fought their way into the main house of the estate where all the patriot powder was housed. But rather than allow the house to fall to the enemy, the republican captain in charge lit the powder, blowing up the house and everyone inside, including himself in the process. This sudden explosion turned the tide back to the republicans, and the Legions of Hell were once again driven off.",
            "But Bolívar’s forces were now in desperate straits here. I mean, it was just a matter of time before they got beat. But that is when Santiago Mariño and 4,300 men finally, finally arrived from the east to help. With Mariño’s fresh army on the way, Boves withdrew rather than get caught between two enemy forces. ",
            "The arrival of Mariño staved off defeat and temporarily halted the advance of the Legions of Hell on Caracas. But this was all only temporary. Boves retired back to Calabozo to recruit more men. And then both sides spent most of April regrouping.",
            "Field Marshal Cajigal finally left Coro in mid-April, headed for Valencia. His plan was to link up with Boves to form a single united front. But it was becoming very clear that Boves was not super interested in taking orders from anyone. So in mid-May, the republicans, now combined under the shared leadership of Bolívar and Mariño, went out looking for Cajigal and found him at Carabobo, where the royalists were stalling, hoping that Boves would come and back them up. But Boves never came. And on May 28, Bolívar and Mariño won a smashing victory against the royalists in the pouring rain. Cajigal was forced to flee on foot with only a few of his staff to a safe spot way out on the Orinoco River. ",
            "But though this was a great victory, do not confuse this Battle of Carabobo with the more famous Battle of Carabobo that will come around in 1821 and which would actually finally pave the way for Venezuelan independence.",
            "But despite the great victory at Carabobo, the republican forces were still weak, and the Legions of Hell were coming back stronger than ever. As I said, for the republicans, every bullet fired and man lost was one less bullet and one less man. Boves, meanwhile, seemed to be drawing from an inexhaustible supply of both. And then, in June, Bolívar made a fatal error. With Boves looking like he was going to make another push through La Puerta, Mariño put himself in a strong defensive position guarding the gate. But Bolívar, remember, is not a man who likes to be on the defensive. So he arrived on the scene with reinforcements and was keen to go after the enemy.",
            "On June 15, 1814, the second Battle of La Puerta began, with the republicans holding a defensive line for quite a while. But then Bolívar surveyed the enemy and said, “Look, there’s not that many of them. I think we can go take them.” Except Boves was keeping, like, half his army out of sight. So when the republicans came out onto the plains, they were set upon and pretty well crushed. The second Battle of La Puerta was catastrophic. The republican forces were shattered, and Bolívar and Mariño had to run all the way back to Caracas.",
            "Boves, meanwhile, was now able to move unimpeded. He first secured the long-targeted city of Valencia by promising the residents leniency if they let him in. And unfortunately, they believed him. The night he entered, he threw a ball and demanded that the women of the city dance for him or he’d kill their husbands, their brothers, and their sons. And so the women danced, and when they were done, Boves killed everyone anyway.",
            "Meanwhile, down in Caracas, total panic had set in. The Legions of Hell were coming, and there was nothing anyone could do to stop them. Even Bolívar could see the futility of resistance. Mariño said that they would all find refuge east in the city of Barcelona. And so Bolívar ordered every piece of gold and silver in the city stripped and loaded into 24 trunks. Then, on July 7, 1814, he and the 1,200 soldiers he still had left said, “We are going to Barcelona, and anyone who wants to come with us, let’s go.”",
            "Now, it’s hard to tell what the population of Caracas was at this point, especially with the Caracas earthquake having already devastated the population. But the vast majority of the inhabitants of Caracas followed Bolívar. Only about 4,000 elected to stay behind. For the next 23 days, a column of refugees from Caracas marched towards Barcelona, and that march turned into a running nightmare of dehydration, starvation, exposure, and disease. Many people just dropped dead along the way. As a grim Simón Bolívar could only watch helplessly from his horse and then just keep riding.",
            "Boves entered Caracas on July 16 and he was greeted by those who stayed behind, who fell into roughly four groups: religious types like priests and nuns, peninsulares assured of safety because they were royalists, blacks and pardos who knew Boves would treat them well, and finally, suicidal patriots who decided to die in their homes rather than run. But the capture of Caracas marked Boves’ break with the royalist cause. He had always been in it for himself and his own men. So Cajigal tried to issue orders, and Boves just blew him off. And it soon became clear that if you were white and still in Caracas, you were dead. It didn’t matter who you were. Blacks and pardos were spared. Then they were promoted and put in charge of the city while whites were located, robbed, and killed. So while there was no formal list of political principles for which the Legions of Hell fought, they were indeed a revolutionary army. ",
            "Thanks to the inexhaustible supply of new recruits for the Legions of Hell, when Boves captured Caracas, a whole separate llaneros army under General Morales was able to ride east and track down the fleeing republicans. And by then, the republicans realized how desperate their situation really was.",
            "When they finally arrived in Barcelona in early August, they found the city in panic. Residents jammed the shoreline, tossing their belongings onto every boat they could find. This was not a place of safe refuge. This was an evacuation zone. Now, most of the bedraggled Caracas refugees stopped walking in Barcelona. But a few of the more intrepid and stronger followed Mariño and the 24 trunks of treasure further east to the city of Cumaná.",
            "Bolívar himself, meanwhile, rode out south with what few forces he had left, joining them with some of Mariño’s existing garrisons near the small town of Aragua, where they hoped to halt the charge of Morales’ branch of the Legions of Hell. Numbers are always tricky in these wars, and I’ve seen Bolívar’s forces reported as low as 2,500 and as high as 6,000. But Morales’ army is always numbered at 8,000 strong. The Legions came roaring into the valley on August 17, and the next day battle was joined. Bolívar’s forces were crushed, sustaining casualties well over 50% and forcing Bolívar and a few other senior officers to flee at high speed for Cumaná. After all the killing at the Battle of Aragua, Morales moved on to the town of Aragua, sacked it, and allegedly left 3,000 dead civilians in his wake. ",
            "The Second Republic was now all but finished. But there was still one more little tragic, kind of pathetic act to play out before the end. When Bolívar reached Cumaná, he learned that Mariño had loaded the all-important 24 trunks of treasure onto some ships run by an Italian captain. But now the Italian captain had taken the trunks hostage. Mariño himself had gone aboard one of the ships to demand their return, but he never came back. So then Bolívar went aboard, but while he was arguing that everyone and everything should be released, the Italian captain ordered his ships to sail. And here great bitter confusion set in amongst the republicans.",
            "Now, Bolívar’s version of the story is that he and Mariño finally got the Italian captain to agree to release most of the treasure as long as he could keep some of it. This business finally settled, the ship headed for the offshore island of Margarita, which was still held by a republican garrison led by Manuel Piar. But by then, Piar had heard that Mariño and Bolívar had loaded up all the treasure on some ships and sailed away, and not unreasonably thought that they were trying to skip town. I mean, this is kind of exactly what Miranda had done. So when the ships approached Margarita, Piar opened fire, forcing them to turn around and head back to Cumaná. ",
            "But when the ships returned to Cumaná, Bolívar and Mariño discovered that everyone there also thought that they had been skipping town. José Félix Ribas was furious at his nephew for apparently abandoning him and the republican cause. So he arrested both Commanders in Chief. Mariño, he threw in jail, and Bolívar, he stripped of command, and then Ribas communicated with Piar to keep up the republican war effort under new leadership. Their respective chiefs deposed Piar would now run the east, while Ribas ran the west. If they won the war, that was.",
            "So, on September 8, 1814, Ribas put both Bolívar and Mariño on a boat and said, “Get the hell out of here. You guys are done.” So once again, Simón Bolívar was headed off into exile, having failed to defend the Second Republic, just as he had failed to defend the First Republic. But as miserable as he may have felt, Bolívar could once again count himself extremely lucky. Because just hours after the ship sailed, Manuel Piar arrived in Cumaná with a company of riflemen, planning to execute both Bolívar and Mariño for treason. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "As you may have noticed, we are in the annual revolving door phase of Simón Bolívar’s revolutionary career. He was forced into exile in 1812. Then he staged a triumphant re-entry into Venezuela in 1813. But then we ended last week with Bolívar heading back into exile in 1814. This week, he will return to Cartagena to restart the project of Spanish American independence, only to find himself yet again on a boat out to sea in 1815, on his way to yet another triumphant re-entry into Venezuela in 1816. The door just goes round and round and round, and, I mean, you’d think at a certain point he’d just give it up. But the man had sworn an oath on top of the Sacred Mount to liberate his country or die trying. So, you know, never give up, never surrender. By Grabthar’s Hammer, by the sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged.",
            "After getting put on a boat by his uncle, José Félix Ribas, Bolívar and his one-time rival, but now fellow exile Santiago Mariño, arrived in Cartagena on September 19, 1814. And upon arrival, Bolívar was greeted warmly by both the city leaders and the common people. Though he was arriving under ignoble circumstances, kicked out of Venezuela by his own senior officers on suspicion of treason, Bolívar’s name was still spoken with reverence in Cartagena. To them, he was still the Liberator, and he was still commissioned as a Brigadier General in the armies of New Granada.",
            "So he took up residence in the former bishop’s palace in Cartagena and started taking meetings with local leaders to get the lay of the land, and what he heard did not fill him with feelings of great patriotic joy. After Bolívar crossed the border into Venezuela to begin the Admirable Campaign, New Granada had gone back to squabbling with itself as the centrifugal forces of federalism pulled everyone apart from everyone else. So when Bolívar arrived in Cartagena in September 1814, he actually found things very similar to the situation when he had first arrived in the city back in 1812: Bogotá and Tunja locked in a fierce rivalry, Cartagena still pretty much just doing their own thing, and royalist forces taking advantage of patriot discord to seep their way back in between them all.",
            "So just before Bolivar had left on the Admirable Campaign, though, things had looked way more unified, with President Antonio Nariño leading the Bogotá centralists into an alliance with the Tunja federalists, led by President Camilo Torres. Well, unfortunately, that alliance had not lasted very long. ",
            "The reason it had not lasted was because Nariño raised an army of about 2,000 men and marched them southwest in the direction of Quito in the summer of 1813. This is just as Bolívar was marching east towards Caracas. Nariño successfully captured the city of Popayán and its all-important gold mine, but as he moved towards the city of Pasto, everything fell apart. His army was defeated by a royalist force and when a rumor went round that Nariño himself had been killed, the army just dissolved. Abandoned in the field, Nariño was himself cornered and captured. So Nariño did complete his march to Quito, but unfortunately, it was as a prisoner of war. Nariño would then get put on a ship that sailed him all the way back to Spain. And this time he would not escape. So by the end of 1815, Antonio Nariño was sitting in a Cádiz prison, the same prison incidentally where Francisco de Miranda now sat. After only a brief stay in Puerto Rico, the old precursor had been sent back across the Atlantic, and he too now sat in a Cádiz jail cell, writing letters to everyone he could think of to try to secure his release. But nobody could do anything for him. And next week, we will say our fond and sad farewell to Francisco de Miranda.",
            "Back in New Granada, the principal upshot of Nariño’s capture was that it allowed the leaders in Bogota to pull back from their partnership with the federalists. Which is why Bolivar found the situation seemingly unchanged when he came back in September 1814. After about a month in Cartagena, Bolivar and Mariño and a few others made their way up to Tunja to try to help reunify the republican forces. Bolívar obviously did not see eye to eye with the federalism of the guys in Tunja, but they were the most united thing going and had been that ones to back his invasion of Venezuela, so he did sort of owe them one. And it was doubly imperative for the patriotic republicans to join under whatever umbrella would hold them all together, because by the time Bolívar got to New Granada, the most sensational news of all had already crossed the Atlantic and it threatened to undo everything, finally and irrevocably. The French had been booted out of Spain, and King Ferdinand VII had been restored to the throne. This was glorious news for everyone but the truly committed republicans like Bolívar, who knew that the liberation of Spain would surely mean the subjugation of America.",
            "So, looking back through the transcripts, we last checked up with events in Spain in Episode 5.9, and we wrapped up there in the spring of 1812 with the ratification of the Constitution of 1812. Now, in terms of the Peninsular War, the situation had turned into a grim and bitter stalemate. The British held Portugal, the Regency and Cortes continued to run out of Cádiz, but King Joseph Bonaparte and the French controlled the rest of the peninsula. Spanish insurgents waged relentless guerrilla war everywhere, but all of them then endured harsh French anti-insurgent retaliation. There seemed to be no end in sight until events on the other side of the world broke the stalemate. Because in June 1812, what happened? That’s right, Napoleon invaded Russia. ",
            "The Russian invasion was catastrophic on its own terms. Napoleon left in June 1812 with 685,000 men and returned in December with just 120,000. But in the bigger picture, the invasion of Russia had a major destabilizing domino effect and pretty much spelled the end of the French occupation of Spain. The Allies were emboldened to launch a new offensive, just as Napoleon was forced to draw troops out of Spain in his ultimately failed attempt to hold on to his collapsing eastern flank.",
            "So, in Iberia, the allied British, Portuguese, and Spanish forces under Wellington advanced in the summer of 1812, and they actually chased King Joseph out of Madrid and taking the capital. But a French counterattack in the fall forced the allies into retreat. By that point, though, reports of the unfolding disaster in Russia were leaking out to all sides. So in early 1813, Wellington launched another offensive, and this now was the beginning of the end for the French.  ",
            "King Joseph abandoned Madrid for good in March, and then, with the French in retreat on all fronts, Wellington and 80,000 men caught up to King Joseph’s retreating 60,000 men at Vitoria on June 21, 1813, and they cracked the French lines. Casualties in this battle were just about equal, but Joseph had to break and run for it, and whatever unity the French forces had left was shattered. They were forced to regroup in a thin sliver of territory up on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees, with the Allies now controlling most of the rest of the peninsula. Wellington kept up his offensive then, and though the campaign was bitterly contested, the French were slowly pushed back into France. And this was happening just as Napoleon was being defeated at Leipzig in October 1813, sending him, too, back into France. A half-million enemy forces were now converging on the Emperor from all sides.",
            "With the French on the run, the Regency government in Cádiz had room to breathe for the first time. And this nicely coincided with elections to the first ordinary Cortes that was to be convened under the Constitution of 1812. That ordinary Cortes would supplant the extraordinary Cortes that had been the effective government of Spain since it first convened itself back in 1810.",
            "As these elections unfolded through 1812 and 1813, though, it became clear that the liberal ideals written into the Constitution were not representative of Spanish public opinion. One of the biggest complaints being that all those liberal ideas looked nearly identical to the policies of the French Bonapartist government. I mean, liberals from across Europe are kind of working from the same batch of theories. So when it came to economic policy, political theory, and the role of the church, the Spanish liberals sounded a lot like the French occupiers. The only major difference, it seems, being that the Spanish liberals wanted Ferdinand to be king rather than Joseph. So with the occupation ending, most Spaniards seemed inclined to dump anything that smelled even remotely French.",
            "So when the new Cortes convened in Cádiz in September 1813, it turned out to be a far more conservative body than its predecessor had been. And one of the first orders of business was voting to reconvene in January in Madrid, removing the government from the backyard of the Cádiz merchants and putting it into the backyard of old-guard absolutists, now coming out of the shadows. But by the time the Cortes reconvened in January, huge, huge news had come. A desperate Napoleon was attempting to stabilize his western flank, and to do so, he decided to finally release Ferdinand from his imprisonment in December 1813. The terms were that Ferdinand would be returned to the Spanish throne, and in exchange, he would agree to a ceasefire with the French and ultimately join France in an alliance against the British and Portuguese. But this was some truly desperate self-deception on Napoleon’s part if he actually thought Ferdinand was going to join him. For one thing, events were now moving way too fast. Ferdinand would not even return to Spain until March. And by then, Napoleon was pretty well beat. He had waged his war against the inevitable through the Six Days campaign of February, but the Allies took Paris in March, and the Emperor himself was forced to abdicate in April 1814 and accept exile to Elba. So even if Ferdinand had wanted to join the French, which he did not, there was never really any time for him to do it anyway.",
            "So with the liberation of Iberia and the collapse of the French Empire, Spain now found itself at a crossroads. For six years, the Regency Cortes had governed in Ferdinand’s name, but now the King himself was free. So would he accept the Constitution of 1812 and embrace a modern constitutional monarchy for Spain? Or would he try to go back prior to the abdications of Bayonne and revive the absolutism of the Bourbon dynasty?",
            "But though the new Cortes now meeting in Madrid is more conservative than the extraordinary Cortes that had met in Cádiz, it was still liberal enough to produce a decree on February 2, 1814, that said that Ferdinand swearing an oath to uphold the Constitution was a prerequisite for them recognizing his sovereignty. So when Ferdinand finally crossed the border back into Spain in March, he was met at the border by a General bearing the February 2 decree.",
            "Now, Ferdinand did not really know what to expect in Spain. I mean, after all, he had been cooped up in a château in France for the last six years, so he took the February 2 decree under advisement. But as he approached Madrid, wherever the restored king went, the people seemed wildly and genuinely to support him. During his years of imprisonment, patriotic Spaniards had come to refer to Ferdinand as the Desired One, though this was not a nickname that’s going to survive his coming reign. Old friends and high-ranking church officials and ministers of the old regime then flocked to Ferdinand’s side, and not one of them advised him to recognize the Cortes or the Constitution of 1812, which suited Ferdinand just fine. Then, in April, the king arrived in Valencia and received the spontaneous backing of an 8,000-man army. Shortly thereafter, he received a petition signed by one-third of the delegates in the Cortes, the most conservative third telling him that they themselves viewed the Cortes and the Constitution as illegitimate because the extraordinary Cortes had not been convened correctly and vastly exceeded its authority when they drafted a new constitution.",
            "So, by the beginning of May 1814, King Ferdinand, the Desired One, had the support of the common people, the church, a significant part of the army, and a big chunk of the Cortes itself. Basically, if he wanted to, he was safe to overthrow the Constitution of 1812, and he really, really wanted to. ",
            "On May 8, 1814, the King signed a decree announcing that the Constitution of 1812 was nullified, and all decrees issued by the Cortes since it had convened in 1810 were hereby vacated. On May 11, the army he controlled entered Madrid and made sweeping arrests of major liberal leaders, sending the rest running into exile. On May 13, the King himself then entered Madrid. The liberal patriot government that had seen Spain through the Peninsula War was dead. Far from being thanked for their service, the men who had run that government were now outlaws or imprisoned. King Ferdinand and his advisors then set to work putting everything back to the way it had been in 1808, right before the abdications of Bayonne. ",
            "So we, of course, need to focus on what this all means for the Americas because, spoiler alert, putting things back the way they had been in 1808 is really not going to fly in the Americas. Even royalists in Spanish America, the guys fighting for God and the King, did not want to go back to heavily restricted trade and arbitrary policies set in Madrid without real participatory input from the Americans. I mean, you couldn’t just pretend like the last six years haven’t happened. But King Ferdinand and his ministers sure are going to try, and their plan was to literally restore all the old audiencias, put back in the intendants and the captain generals, and restore all the viceroys and just generally make sure that the peninsulares were back in control of the Americas. ",
            "But there was some recognition in the restored Bourbon monarchy that many places in the Americas were still in rebellion. Venezuela is, of course, a mess, as was the Río de la Plata. New Granada is still mostly in rebellion. New Spain is still grappling with insurgent armies. But unlike the Cortes, Ferdinand now had troops that he could use to impose a little order. With Napoleon safely imprisoned at Elba (ha ha ha!), the Reconstituted Council of the Indies formally recommended to the King in September 1814 that a huge armada be sent to begin the reconquest, and the King said, “That sounds great.” So a massive expedition slowly came together in Cádiz, ultimately numbering 10,500 troops, sailing on 60 ships of various shapes and sizes. It was the single largest military expedition the Spanish had ever sent to the Americas, and its destination was the war-torn and bloody province of Venezuela.",
            "Now, King Ferdinand and his ministers are going to make a lot of mistakes between now and, oh let’s say, 1820 — a lot! But they made a surprisingly good decision when they picked the man to lead this expedition. They went with General Pablo Morillo. Morillo was a lifelong soldier, almost literally. He had joined the Spanish Marines in 1791 at the tender age of 13. And so he came of age during the wars of the French Revolution, though he generally found himself on the losing side. In 1793, he had served in the Spanish contingent at the Siege of Toulon and so was among those sent running by the audacious attack of young Napoleon Bonaparte. Morillo was then stationed in the Pyrenees through 1794. But as the levée en masse slowly began to overwhelm the Spanish defenses, he was taken prisoner by the French in early 1795. But that was just as the Spanish were capitulating. So upon his release, Morillo rejoined the army and found himself fighting alongside the French rather than against the French.",
            "For the next decade, Morillo fought the British, culminating with his participation at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where he was wounded and taken prisoner again. Now, I can’t quite nail down when the British released him, but Morillo was a free man when the abdications of Bayonne hit in 1808, whereupon he volunteered for the Patriot Army and found himself once again fighting against the French rather than alongside them. And that’s the life of a professional soldier. Your friend today is your enemy tomorrow, is your friend again the day after that.",
            "Morillo served with distinction during the Peninsular War and was known for his personal courage and knack for actually winning battles. So his ascent up the chain of command was rapid. He had signed up in 1808 as a mere Lieutenant, and five years later, as Wellington was preparing for the final push, Morillo was a Field Marshal in the Spanish army. During that final campaign, he once again served with notable distinction and basically, Pablo Morillo was a smart, dedicated, patriotic, and experienced officer. And while on almost every other front, King Ferdinand would prove himself to be a disastrous judge of both character and policy, he somehow accidentally appointed Morillo to command the expedition to restore order in Spanish America. ",
            "Morillo was further granted broad power and discretion to complete his mission, a mission that was nothing less than the end of independence in South America. The King formally appointed him governor and Captain General of Venezuela and President of the restored Caracas audiencia. With all of these powers in hand, he was ordered to then land in Venezuela at the head of this mighty fleet, use whatever combination of carrot and stick he thought best to bring the natives to heel, and then move on to New Granada on his way ultimately down to Lima, Peru. Bolívar fears back in the Cartagena Manifesto that Venezuela would become the Coro of all South America. It looks like that’s coming true.",
            "So Morillo and his armada set sail from Cádiz in February 1815 on a two-month-long voyage across the Atlantic. And they expected, when they landed on the other side, to be landing right in the middle of a bloody and bitter Venezuelan civil war. But by the time they arrived in April 1815, it turned out that the bloody and bitter civil war was pretty much over, and the Second Republic had been dead, dead, dead for months. ",
            "To wrap up that war, let’s go back to September 1814, just after José Félix Ribas has put Bolívar and Mariño on a boat.",
            "Now, Ribas and Manuel Piar plan to vigorously defend this last little enclave of republican power they had, but the situation was now reversed from a year ago. The royalists, or more specifically, Boves and the Legions of Hell, controlled almost the whole country, with the Republicans limited to this little enclave down around the city of Cumaná. The end of the Second Republic honestly feels pretty inevitable at this point.",
            "In October 1814, Boves advanced east, forcing Ribas and what was left of the patriot forces to just abandon Cumaná. Now, Ribas managed to keep a force in the field until December, but they were finally cornered at Urica and forced to fight against an army that outnumbered them two to one. Smashed by the Legions of Hell, the Patriot Army just ceased to exist. The only consolation being that as the republican forces broke, Boves himself took a spear to the heart that killed him instantly.",
            "But though the death of Boves is good for the republicans in the long run, in the short term, it did them no good. Ribas fled west, trying to make his way back to New Granada. But after taking refuge outside the city of Pascua, he was betrayed and captured. The royalists who found him then killed Ribas, cut off his head, and fried it in a vat of boiling oil. The head was then sent along to Caracas where it was put on public display for all to see. The only part of republican Venezuela now left was a small garrison holding the island of Margarita under Manuel Piar. And they would find themselves not lasting very long because the destination of Morillo’s giant armada was the island of Margarita.",
            "So bringing this all back around now to Bolívar. By the time that he was heading up to Tunja from Cartagena, he knew that Spain had been liberated and the King restored. He did not yet know about Morillo’s expedition, but it was not too hard to guess that something like it was probably on the way. When Bolívar reached Tunja, he once again found himself greeted as a hero rather than a goat. President Camilo Torres hailed him as a great man who just so happened to be unlucky in the field.",
            "Now, the principal concern of both Torres and Bolívar at this point was bringing Bogotá back into the shared fold of the Union of New Granada, and the Congress in Tunja put 1,800 men under General Bolívar’s command and said, “Go to Bogotá and make them see reason.” Bolívar and his new little army reached the gates of Bogotá on December 10, 1814, and despite a brief show of resistance, the people of Bogotá didn’t have much in the way of a military force to withstand a siege. Bolívar promised leniency if they opened their gates. And so, after two days, they did. And unlike Boves, Bolívar kept his word. He didn’t go running into slaughter everybody.",
            "With Bogotá now under Bolivar’s military authority, the Tunja government voted to reconvene in the old viceregal capital. It was bigger, it was richer, and more importantly, it would cement the sense of shared purpose and help everyone keep an eye on everyone else. ",
            "With Bogotá secured, Bolívar then planned a reverse Magdalena campaign. Over the past year, resurgent royalist forces had been retaking positions all up and down the river. So in January 1815, Bolívar set out with more than 2,000 men down the river, rather than up it, to clear them all out, reestablish communication lines with Cartagena, and then, most importantly, keep pushing on to the port of Santa Marta that sat at the mouth of the Magdalena River. That city was currently held by royalists, and Bolívar wanted to make sure that the inevitable force from Spain that would be coming inevitably would have no safe place to land in New Granada.",
            "But once again, Bolívar’s dreams of a unified American defense against a Spanish invasion were stymied by his fellow Americans. Specifically, this time it was a guy named Colonel Manuel Castillo. Now, this is not the first time that we have met Castillo. And to be honest, the only reason I didn’t mention his name the first time we met him is that I forgot that he was the same guy who’s going to be causing trouble for Bolívar now. Remember the colonel who resigned with 100 of his men rather than follow Bolívar into Venezuela? That was Colonel Castillo. The same Colonel Castillo who was about to drive Bolívar into exile and bring Cartagena to ruin. ",
            "So Colonel Manuel Castillo pretty much hated Bolívar, thought him a crazy fanatic who wanted to spill New Granadan blood and waste New Granadan resources on hare-brained schemes in Venezuela, which isn’t like 100% inaccurate, but from Bolívar’s perspective, their shared sense of purpose and sacrifice was supposed to be for the greater good. Well, Castillo wants no part of that. And he was in Cartagena when Bolívar came back. And as soon as the fanatical little Venezuelan left for Tunja, Castillo started up a smear campaign against Bolívar. He played up the stories of Bolívar’s betrayal at Cumaná, how it was not clear whether Bolívar’s incompetence or cowardice had contributed more to the collapse of the Second Republic. And Castillo did a good job rebranding Bolívar as a villain. So by the time Bolívar arrived at the lower reaches of the Magdalena River, he was informed that Cartagena was no longer his friend and that Castillo was recruiting troops not to fight the Spanish, but to fight Bolívar. ",
            "So this forced Bolívar to break off his approach on Santa Marta and instead focus on Cartagena, which meant that through March and April 1815, Bolívar’s forces just kind of sat around on the swampy lower reaches of the Magdalena River, while Bolívar tried to negotiate his way back into the good graces of Cartagena. This all led to the onset of camp diseases that killed both men and morale, and desertions from his army became frequent. Bolívar finally decided to try to force the issue, and he marched on Cartagena, hopefully to get them to open up their gates as Bogotá had. But instead, as Bolívar approached, Castillo opened fire with the heavy guns, forcing Bolívar and his forces to take cover. And then, even worse, it turned out that Castillo had poisoned all the wells in the surrounding area, so drinking water was nonexistent.",
            "The depressing siege of Cartagena took its toll on Bolívar. And I have to think at this point that doubts really were starting to creep in about whether any of this was ever going to work. And then on April 24, 1815, the other shoe finally dropped. Jubilant royalists carried through news that the great Spanish armada of 60 ships and 14,000 men, or so it was reported, had landed on the island of Margarita and destroyed the last of the republican forces. It was only a matter of time before they moved on to New Granada. As Bolívar was processing this information, he got word that a royalist unit had attacked and taken Mompox in his rear. So now, down to just 700 men and surrounded by enemies of every variety on all sides, and the great hammer of Morillo, perhaps just a few weeks away, Bolívar gave up. He sent a letter to Cartagena saying, “I will resign my commission and leave the country as long as you take care of my men.” ",
            "Castillo agreed to these terms. And so, on May 8, 1815, Bolívar once again got on a boat, headed into exile, his third such trip in less than four years. This was really not working out the way Bolívar had intended. ",
            "So this time, the once again exiled Bolívar headed for Jamaica. And he had there at least one friendly contact, an adventurous merchant named Maxwell Heslop, who had been among those selling black market guns to the Second Republic. Heslop promised Bolívar money and the use of a 24-gun ship he owned for the cause of Spanish American independence, but for the rest of 1815, that cause seemed lost, and Bolívar had to just sit in Kingston and stew. ",
            "But despite all this, Bolívar could still count himself as lucky because it had been a really good time to get out of New Granada. Now, the armada of Pablo Morillo did not immediately come over to Cartagena. They lingered in Caracas for the summer of 1815 as Morillo tried to restore order to a province that had just been leveled by civil war and natural catastrophe. I mean, whole towns were now just abandoned ruins. The Legions of Hell alone can be blamed for about 80,000 civilian casualties during their marauding, and you add into that the Caracas earthquake and various republican atrocities in the war to the death, and then just disease and starvation and people fleeing the country. I mean, it wouldn’t surprise me if the casualties ran as high as 200,000. And this from a province that had only about 800,000 in it on the eve of the abdications of Bayonne. So we’re talking about one full quarter of the population here.",
            "But once Morillo felt like he had Venezuela kind of on its feet, or perhaps just to the point where he could hand it to civilian authorities and get back to soldiering, Morillo left Venezuela in September 1815 with his armada and headed for Cartagena. ",
            "Now, the fortifications of Cartagena were as impressive as they had been when the British had failed to take the city way back during the War of Jenkins’ Ear. As long as the residents don’t give up hope, there’s no way that even 60 ships and 10,000 men could take the city. And while the residents were perhaps a bit reticent about all this, Colonel Castillo was determined to not let the city fall. And he introduced martial law to make sure no one’s resolve broke even as the situation got worse and worse and worse. The siege of Cartagena would ultimately drag on for four months. The walls would stay firm, but everyone inside would wither. ",
            "But Bolívar is lucky he’s not trapped in Cartagena. He is, in fact, now in Kingston, Jamaica, living on a small stipend arranged by his merchant friend. And if he had ever let self-doubt creep in while sitting outside of Cartagena, Bolívar didn’t show it in Jamaica. He sent out an explosion of letters every which way, seeking aid from everyone he could think of in the United States, whether working in the government or in the private sector. He sent letters to the old British Foreign Minister, Richard Wellesley, begging for assistance — men, money, whatever you can spare. But the world was turning a deaf ear.",
            "Just recently freed from the War of 1812, President James Madison went back to trying to stay out of European entanglements and signed a law forbidding US citizens from joining any campaign in Spanish America. As for the British, after their great victory at Waterloo, they proceeded to sign an agreement with the members of the Holy Alliance — Prussia, Russia, and Austria — the goal now being stability, sweet stability after 25 years of nonstop war. So the British also made it illegal for their officers to sign up for service in Spanish America, though, as we will see, more than a few are going to come anyway.",
            "The most famous letter Bolívar wrote during this period of exile in Jamaica, though, was not a request for aid but rather a response to a request for information. An Englishman living on the other side of Jamaica had been curious about what had gone wrong in Venezuela and what the prospects were for Spanish American independence. Bolívar answered in early September 1815, with a long letter that seemed very much to be written with an eye on being disseminated to a wider audience than just the recipient. And indeed it would be. Along with the Cartagena Manifesto, the letter from Jamaica is a statement of Bolívar’s political principles and also a nuanced and fairly prescient analysis of politics in Spanish America, a lot of which still holds up today. But I’m going to talk about the letter from Jamaica in more detail next week because Bolívar surveys the current status of all the various regions of Spanish America, and I want to use that as a framework to spend next week pretty much doing the same thing to get us caught up on all fronts as we move to the next phase of Spanish American independence.",
            "Now, meanwhile, things in Cartagena were getting really bad. By the end of November 1815, there was nothing to eat, there was nothing to drink. Disease and starvation had set in, and already close to 6,000 people had died. Now, Colonel Castillo was prepared to hold on until everyone inside was dead. But everyone else had had enough.",
            "In early December, a cabal of senior military commanders, including a cadre of Venezuelans in exile, deposed Colonel Castillo. With Castillo removed from power, 2,000 residents of Cartagena abandoned the city for the shoreline where they pitifully surrendered themselves to the Spanish. The next day, December 6, 1815, Morillo’s army entered Cartagena. As they secured the nearly empty city, they found Castillo cowering in the corner of a house. He was arrested, taken down to the main square of the city, and shot.",
            "Now, coincidentally enough, it was just a few days after the fall of Cartagena that Simón Bolívar found himself once again on the run, with every intention of running back to Cartagena, not knowing, of course, that the city had already fallen. And what he was running from is a mysterious little episode because apparently Bolívar had grown to dislike his landlady and on December 10, 1815, decided to move to different lodgings.",
            "The very next day, an exiled Venezuelan officer, Bolívar’s former paymaster, actually arrived in Kingston, looking to reconnect with his old chief. This guy went to Bolívar’s now former lodgings, not knowing that they were his now former lodgings, and not finding Bolívar, this unfortunate guy decided to go to sleep in Bolívar’s old hammock.",
            "Now, the reason I call this guy unfortunate is that all of this coincided with a conspiracy to assassinate the Liberator. Bolívar’s black attendant had been promised 2,000 pesos, an obscene amount of money, to kill Bolívar. And it just so happened that the murder was planned for that very night. So the assassin slipped into Bolívar’s apartment and stabbed the body in the hammock to death. Except it wasn’t Bolívar who was dead. It was just some random guy.",
            "Now, nobody knows who orchestrated this assassination attempt, but Bolívar quite rightly determined that he was no longer safe in Jamaica. ",
            "So on December 18, 1815, Bolívar loaded up a ship with supplies and decided to return to Cartagena to see what he could do to help his old comrades withstand the siege. But shortly after setting sail, they passed some ships coming the other direction that told them, yeah, no, Cartagena has fallen already, so it isn’t safe for Bolívar anywhere. Where could he now go?",
            "The answer brings us back around to the final episode of the Haitian revolution. With no place to go on the mainland and without support from any of the other major powers in the Caribbean, there was only one place Bolívar could go—the Republic of Haiti. Bolívar was told that he would find asylum in Haiti. And so, on Christmas Eve, 1815, a beleaguered Bolívar landed in Les Cayes."

    "5.13 – The Letter from Jamaica": {
        "h1": "Elpidio Valdes",
        "paragraphs": [
            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "In September 1815, Simón Bolívar sat down to compose a letter. At this point, he was still living in Kingston, Jamaica, renting from a landlady he would soon find intolerable, setting the stage for his lucky escape from the assassin’s knife just a few months hence. During the course of his extensive correspondence during these months in exile, a letter came through from an Englishman living on the other side of Jamaica named Henry Cullen. Cullen was curious about Spanish America, its history, the course of the independence movement, and what the prospects were for the future. And Bolívar used this request from Cullen, much like Edmund Burke took a letter asking for his opinion of the French Revolution, as a springboard for a general public treatise. Marshaling the full breadth of his historical education, which was considerable by this point, Bolívar surveyed South America and wrote up his thoughts, clearly intending them to be for a wider audience than just Cullen himself. And Cullen indeed did translate the letter and forward it to friends in England, where it was eventually published. ",
            "Now, for about the next decade, the letter from Jamaica was only known to British liberals and a few Spanish American exiles. But in the fullness of time, the letter would be rediscovered and translated back into Spanish, whereupon it would become a centerpiece of understanding Simón Bolívar and the times in which he lived.",
            "So what I want to do here today is run through the letter from Jamaica to start with, but then use it as a springboard to talk about two regions in particular that are about to become very important to the next phase of Spanish American independence: the Río de la Plata and Chile. Because today we are going to introduce two new giant pieces to the board, José de San Martín and Bernardo O’Higgins.",
            "Bolívar began his letter by complimenting Mr. Cullen on the proper degree of hostility Cullen showed for the Spaniards. Bolívar agreed that they were the worst, a wicked stepmother who reigned tyrannically over the oppressed Americans, and most especially Bolívar now blamed them for keeping the Americans in a state of political infancy, governed by peninsular despotism with its heavy mix of censorship, superstition, and inquisition, Spanish Americans had been denied the habits of participatory government. This lack of a practiced republican ethic was the source of Spanish American disunity and why Bolívar would remain a strong centralist for his whole life. As he had already said in the Cartagena Manifesto, emerging states needed a strong central hand, especially when trying to govern a citizen body just emerging from the tyrannical shadow of Spanish despotism.",
            "After properly scolding the Spanish, Bolívar then moved on to tracing the course of events after the abdications of Bayonne, attempting to explain the American response to the chaos in Europe and how it had led to movements for autonomy culminating with all those declarations of independence in 1810. But Bolívar was now riding five years past those heady days when everything was thrilling and romantic. I mean, it’s now September 1815, and Bolívar himself is a thrice-exiled failure. Venezuela lay in ruins after a war to the death. Pablo Morillo’s huge armada was laying siege to Cartagena. King Ferdinand had been restored to the Spanish throne, all of which seemed to spell the end for American independence. So when Bolívar turned his attention to the future, you might think he would wallow in a little pessimism. But if there’s one thing Bolívar was not, was a pessimist. He could be a cynical realist. He could be a cold-blooded killer, but he was never going to be a pessimist.",
            "So Bolívar’s optimistic commitment to independence was unshakeable because he believed independence was now inevitable, as he explained to Mr. Cullen. Employing an argument similar to the one made by Tom Paine in Common Sense back in 1776, Bolívar argued that the very fact of armed conflict had already made future reconciliation impossible, that if the Spanish reconquered the Americas, the whole thing would just play out again a generation later. In Bolívar’s eyes, the bonds were already permanently severed; it was just a matter of when everyone else would wake up to reality. So, as he turned to survey the future course of Spanish America, Bolívar wrote under the assumption that in the end, independence would win. And though he would remain a committed large state centralist, by now he also did agree that Spanish America would not devolve into four large countries roughly conforming to the old viceroyalties, but rather something like 15 to 17 new nations, which is remarkably close to what wound up actually happening.",
            "So, you can probably already guess what Bolívar thought lay in store for New Granada and Venezuela. Even after being kicked out of both countries and seeing very little evidence of their mutual solidarity, Bolívar still believed that in the end, they would join together in a new nation called Colombia. But this nation would be governed by a British-style system with a Senate, House of Commons, and an Executive for life. Centralist republican to his core, Bolívar just couldn’t picture anything but Gran Colombia. And so, in the end, he was wrong about his prediction, but it’s going to take us the whole rest of this series to explain exactly why.",
            "Bolívar also missed the mark with his prediction for the neighboring Isthmus of Panama, though he did make an interesting observation that just didn’t pan out. He predicted that the Isthmus provinces as far north as Guatemala would join into a single confederation, and then that confederation would capitalize on their control of the all-important trade lines between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Bolívar predicted a city as great as Constantinople would one day be planted betwixt the two great oceans. But neither the confederation nor Panama-stinople ever came about.",
            "He was closer to the mark concerning New Spain, of which he wrote, “For reasons of geography, wealth, population, and character, I imagine that the Mexicans will initially attempt to establish a representative republic, granting great powers to the executive, concentrating it in a single individual who, if he performs his duties properly and fairly, will almost certainly hold his authority for life.” But then he also went on to say that if the ruling party is military or aristocratic, it will likely demand a monarchy, which will at first be limited and constitutional but inevitably deteriorate into absolutism. That does actually sound a lot like what goes on in Mexico, though as I’ve also said, we’re not going to worry too much about New Spain in this series because we’re going to deal with all of it when we get to the Mexican Revolution.",
            "So that takes us on down to southern South America, about which Bolívar admitted a lack of information hindered his judgment. But luckily, we do not share his ignorance because we know everything that happened down in southern South America. And so, for the rest of today’s episode, we are going to leap away from the letter from Jamaica and dive headlong first into the Río de la Plata and then Chile. And then we can circle back around to see whether Bolívar’s predictions hold up. But more importantly, beyond solid footing as we enter the next phase of Spanish American independence, which is going to be defined by a great double envelopment of Peru as Simón Bolívar marches down from New Granada and José de San Martín marches up from Chile.",
            "So, the last time I mentioned the Río de la Plata was near the beginning of Episode 5.8 when I said that the fall of Seville in 1810 triggered the May Revolution, which led to a dangerous struggle for power that pitted everyone against everyone else. And at the time, I also said it was a mess that we were not going to fall into. But it is now time to fall into that mess.",
            "Now, the last time we really talked about the Río de la Plata was way back in Episode 5.5 when we discussed the British invasions of 1806 and 1807. And if you’ll recall, the hero of that crisis had been that French mercenary Santiago Liniers. Liniers had been so effective that the Town Council of Buenos Aires deposed the sitting viceroy and promoted Liniers to acting Viceroy. And then he stayed on as acting Viceroy even through the abdications of Bayonne, though he did have to sufficiently prove his hostility to the Bonapartes.",
            "During his two years in power, Liniers opened up Buenos Aires to free trade and used customs duties to pay the wages of 8,000 militiamen now under arms. They were well-drilled, organized, and made up almost entirely of the mixed-race lower classes. But in 1809, the Central Junta took it upon itself to appoint a new Viceroy to replace Liniers. Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. When Cisneros arrived, Liniers peacefully stepped aside. ",
            "Acting on behalf of the monopoly-loving Cádiz merchants, though, Cisneros quickly undermined his own authority by ending free trade in Buenos Aires. This not only angered the merchants and intellectual liberals, but it also shut down the customs revenue that Liniers had been using to pay the militia.",
            "So, Cisneros was already on thin ice when Buenos Aires heard about the fall of Seville at the end of May 1810. Cisneros and the viceregal authorities tried to navigate the news, but an alliance between disgruntled militiamen and radical intellectuals demanded an open meeting of the Buenos Aires Town Council to discuss the city’s response to the crisis. After days of heated debate, this open council voted on May 25, 1810, to create an independent junta. Viceroy Cisneros was deposed, and he was put on a boat to the Canary Islands, along with any other peninsulares the junta found insufficiently patriotic. The Buenos Aires junta then invited all other provinces in the Río de la Plata to send delegates to join the government. But we’ve seen this game play out before, and the other provinces rejected taking orders from the metropolis. The other major cities of the viceroyalty, Montevideo, Asunción, Chuquisaca, all kept Buenos Aires at arm’s length. And here we find some of the basic divisions that will help turn the four viceroyalties into 15 to 17 new nations, because the three cities I just named are the future capitals of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia. ",
            "The city of Montevideo was always Buenos Aires’ most important rival. The two cities lay on opposite sides of the great Río de la Plata estuary, and since their earliest days, had competed over trade, power, and wealth. If Buenos Aires said butterside up, Montevideo said butterside down. So, two days after receiving an invitation to join the Buenos Aires Junta, the leaders of Montevideo got together and declared their allegiance to the regency. On top of that, the peninsular Governor of the city, Francisco Javier de Elío, learned that Cisneros had been deposed and declared himself the new Viceroy of the Río de la Plata.",
            "But Montevideo was not the only city to keep its distance from Buenos Aires. Deep in the interior, the city of Asunción and the future country of Paraguay had their own interests to think about. Their small manufacturing and livestock and textiles supplied the silver-rich province of Upper Peru with goods and services. The biggest threat Paraguay faced was liberals down on the coast declaring free trade because the flood of cheap goods from Spain and Britain would, and did, crowd out local operators. So when word of the fall of Seville arrived, Asunción called its own junta, rather than sending delegates down to Buenos Aires. The Asunción Junta would soon come under the influence of one of the very few well-educated men in the region, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who everyone called Dr. Francia.",
            "And here we get what makes Paraguay different from the others because over the course of the next few years, Dr. Francia will proceed in stages through member of the junta to President of Asunción, for five years, then President of Asunción for life, to supreme and perpetual dictator of Paraguay. And then he just doesn’t go anywhere. Dr. Francia will rule Paraguay until 1840. Ruling with a strong and, in later years, fairly brutal hand, Dr. Francia’s Paraguay would maintain political stability over the next 30 years that no other country in South America would approach.",
            "But Paraguay was off the beaten path a little bit, and with Montevideo instantly for the regency, the guys in Buenos Aires focused their attention on making sure that Upper Peru remained in their orbit, this is the future Bolivia, because that’s where all the silver was. After the first cry of liberty in 1809, the capital of Chuquisaca had fallen back under the royalist umbrella. So in the summer of 1810, Buenos Aires sent an armed expedition to reassert patriotic control. And this expedition was a mix of political officials and militia forces that were to spread the decrees of the Buenos Aires government and make whatever reforms were deemed necessary to the existing political structure.",
            "But before they even got to Upper Peru, this expedition found themselves blocked by a small counter-revolution that had broken out in the city of Cordoba. This revolt was being led by former acting Viceroy Santiago Liniers. The junta’s forces attacked, though, and in the ensuing battle, Liniers was captured and then executed, which was a very unpopular decision because Liniers was still the hero of those British invasions and most of the militia companies had been formed under his auspices. So just killing him was not going to win Buenos Aires any friends. ",
            "And then things got no better for the expedition once they finally reached Upper Peru. Now, they did successfully clear out the few royalist garrisons around, but then they began imposing all kinds of revolutionary reforms that the locals really didn’t appreciate, especially since the expedition was notoriously secular and had very little respect for the traditional Catholic Church.",
            "So if the point of the expedition was to bring Upper Peru under Buenos Aires’ control, the mission failed miserably, and they would all be getting tossed out in just a few months. ",
            "Meanwhile, back down on the coast, self-declared Viceroy Elío was confirmed at his new post by the Cádiz Cortes, and in February 1811, he declared war on the rebels in Buenos Aires. But he found little support outside of the city of Montevideo itself, because out in the countryside of the Banda Oriental, the cowboys, ranchers, and small farmers all turned against Spanish rule and coalesced around a patriotic general named José Artigas.",
            "Artigas was a little bit like Bolívar, the heir of a wealthy family of ranchers. He received a top-flight formal education but was also raised among the rustic cowboys who ran his family’s estate. Artigas was back in Spain when the abdication of Bayonne hit and then served in the Spanish army during the early stages of the Peninsular War. And in fact, he had only just returned home on the eve of the May Revolution in 1810. Artigas initially stayed in the Spanish army but deserted when Viceroy Elío declared war on Buenos Aires. Offering his service to Buenos Aires, Artigas was made a Colonel, and then he set to work recruiting from among the ranchers and cowboys. And soon he had a large and intensely loyal force behind him. By the summer of 1811, this cowboy army was joining with militia forces from Buenos Aires to lay siege to Montevideo. But there was a problem. The patriots had no navy to speak of, and until they did, Montevideo could be resupplied forever.",
            "But the siege did prompt Viceroy Elío to turn north and beg Queen Charlotte of Portugal for assistance. Still, the one member of the Bourbon royal family free from the clutches of Napoleon, Queen Charlotte had long tried, though with very little to show for it, to become the recognized sovereign of the orphaned Americans. With Montevideo under siege, she had now a golden opportunity to advance Portuguese interests south of the Brazilian border. So not only did Charlotte literally pawn crown jewels to keep Montevideo supplied, she started gathering an armed expedition of her own to help relieve it. ",
            "News that the Portuguese might now be getting into it was just the latest bad news in a year of bad news for Buenos Aires. They had sent a small force up to Asunción, but that force had been repelled by the Paraguayans in March 1811. Then they found out that in Upper Peru, the leader of the junta’s expeditionary force had gotten it in his head to keep marching all the way to Lima. But instead, they were blocked in the mountains and defeated in June 1811. This defeat scattered the junta’s forces and allowed the royalists to retake Upper Peru. As these military defeats mounted and dissatisfaction with the junta growing, radicals inside Buenos Aires staged a coup. With the threat from Portugal now looming, a quick uprising in September 1811 overthrew the existing leadership and put into place a new three-man triumvirate, with the junta reduced to a mere legislative branch. Fearing complete collapse if the Portuguese entered the fray, the new triumvirate signed an armistice with Viceroy Elío that nominally acknowledged his authority, without actually acknowledging his authority. But left hanging out to dry was José Artigas. Cut out of the negotiations by both sides, Artigas and his followers were now exposed to retaliation from Brazil or Montevideo, triggering one of the most famous events in the course of all this: the Exodus of the Easterners.",
            "In October 1811, Artigas led a huge train of covered wagons into the interior. Whole families and communities relocated to the west bank of the Uruguay River. There, Artigas and his people would regroup away from the range of the Portuguese, Montevideo, or Buenos Aires, none of whom they now trusted. ",
            "But though they had been forced to recognize the Viceroy, the men now running Buenos Aires were more radically liberal than ever. The dominant force of the new triumvirate would not be one of the triumvirs, but instead their secretary, Bernardino Rivadavia. A true acolyte of the Enlightenment, Rivadavia married new Benthamite liberal reform policies to old-style enlightened despotism, and he envisioned the whole of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata falling under the jurisdiction of an aggressively liberal reformist government based in Buenos Aires. Free trade, extensive education, respect for property rights, and civil rights, the works, all of it to be done without asking permission or forgiveness.",
            "In December 1811, the old junta tried to stage a coup against the growing tyranny of Rivadavia’s triumvirate, but it failed and was savagely repressed. And in the aftermath, the national junta was dissolved. And then a few weeks later, in January 1812, the triumvirate ordered all provincial juntas to cease operations at once, and then they resumed the siege of Montevideo. But again, without a navy, the whole operation was pretty much doomed. ",
            "So this was the military and political situation in March 1812 when one of the highest-ranking criollo officers in the Spanish army arrived: José de San Martín. The only person who rivals Simón Bolivar in the grand scheme of Spanish American independence is José de San Martín.",
            "Now, I first mentioned him when talking about the early days of the Peninsular War because he fought in the Peninsular War and was at the key Battle of Bailén. But when I mentioned him, I said that he was from Buenos Aires, which is not actually true. He was born in the interior town of Yapeyú, where his father was a provincial administrator. But the family did relocate to Buenos Aires when little José was just three, before moving on again back to Spain, where San Martín would live from the age of seven until his “return home” to the Río de la Plata as a 33-year-old deserter from the Spanish army more than 25 years later.",
            "Once they got to Spain, San Martín and his brothers all joined the army and all enjoyed a similar rise up the ranks. Just a few years older than Pablo Morillo, San Martín joined the cadets in 1789 at the age of eleven and then served through the wars of the French Revolution, once being captured by the British in 1798. San Martín was still in the Spanish army in 1808 when the abdications of Bayonne hit, and he was actually serving as a watch commander in Cádiz. And he was unable to stop a mob attack on French ships anchored in the harbor, an attack that left his friend and commanding officer dead. And San Martín is never going to be a populist radical. He’s always going to be fairly conservative in his political leanings.",
            "After the French invasion, San Martín then joined the patriot Spanish army in 1808 as a lieutenant. And as I mentioned, he was promoted to Colonel after his valor at the Battle of Bailén. By 1810, San Martín was an adjutant General helping run the army of Catalonia, and he was, in fact, one of the highest-ranking criollo officers in the Spanish army at the time. But the disasters of early 1810 seemed to have turned San Martín’s attention back to the Río de la Plata. The Spanish army had been crushed, and Seville had fallen. I mean, how much longer could the regency last against the might of Napoleonic France?",
            "So after 1810, San Martín stayed in uniform, but he also came into contact with various British agents in Cádiz and liberal members of the Order of Rational Knights, a revolutionary Masonic group based in Cádiz. On September 14, 1811, San Martín used a passport forged by the British to cross over to London under an assumed name. After 22 years of service, José de San Martín was a deserter. ",
            "He arrived in London penniless and friendless, but as all penniless and friendless South Americans found upon arrival in London, San Martín was welcomed into Francisco de Miranda’s house on Grafton Street. Now Miranda himself had already departed for his own destiny in Venezuela by the time San Martín arrived in late 1811, but the revolutionary intellectual Andrés Bello still lived there. And though the old precursor was gone and never to return, as it turned out, San Martín found a supportive home on Grafton Street. He was inducted into Miranda’s Grand Reunion Lodge by Andrés Bello and also at Grafton Street met and befriended another young dissident criollo officer named Carlos María de Alvear, and the two discussed plans for the future of the Río de la Plata. After a few months, San Martín arranged passage back to Buenos Aires and departed. Alvear was close behind him.",
            "So upon arrival in Buenos Aires in March 1812, San Martín was eagerly greeted and brought into the patriotic folds. He was, after all, like an adjutant General in the Spanish Army. But San Martin was no passive agent to be used. He immediately founded a branch of the Masonic Rational Knights called the Lautaro Lodge, which created a network of like-minded leaders and probably the most important of their shared philosophies being that they believed that only a Pan-American front against the Spanish would secure their collective independence. This is going to make them natural allies of the Bolívarians up in the north. And it can’t have been too long before San Martín started planning his invasion of Peru. San Martín always saw the big picture, and he believed that removing the royalists from Lima was essential to the security of South America. ",
            "But for the moment, he focused on the simple defenses against incursions from royalists coming out of Upper Peru and the grateful leaders of Buenos Aires put San Martín in charge of reorganizing their armed forces, which had not performed well in the field since the May Revolution. ",
            "So as San Martín got to work organizing the army and earning its loyalty, his Masonic brother, Carlos María de Alvear, arrived and set to work undermining the triumvirate. The enlightened despotism of Rivadavia had started rubbing people the wrong way. And in particular, San Martín and Rivadavia hated each other. In mid-1812, the popular patriot General was deemed an enemy of the regime and executed along with 40 of his senior officers, which struck many as unjust and harsh. So after a summer spent maneuvering in the shadows, San Martín, Alvear, and their Masonic brothers moved in for the kill in October 1812. They forced the triumvirate to resign and kicked Rivadavia out of office. Then they orchestrated the formation of a second triumvirate with mostly figureheads holding the three positions. San Martín stayed with the armies. Alvear stayed behind the scenes as the triumvirate’s permanent secretary. ",
            "The second triumvirate then called for a Río de la Plata-wide congress to convene in early 1813, but they still found few takers. Montevideo, of course, just ignored them, as did José Artigas and his people, Dr. Francia and the Paraguayans, and then everybody up in Upper Peru. Now, in May 1813, Buenos Aires sent a second expedition to Upper Peru that was able to temporarily reoccupy the region. But by the end of the year, it was all bad news for Buenos Aires, again. In September, Montevideo received some much-needed peninsular reinforcements. And then in November, that second expedition to Upper Peru was also driven out. ",
            "So, the stalemate that was now setting in in the Río de la Plata held until 1814. At the beginning of that year, the second triumvirate gave way to a single supreme dictator, a guy named Gervasio Antonio de Posadas. But he doesn’t really matter because he’s just the face man for Alvear, now promoted to Commander in Chief of the army and the power behind the throne. Now, during this little governmental shake-up, San Martín took what appeared to be a demotion, taking over as Governor of the frontier province of Cuyo. But this was just preparation for San Martín’s grand plan. Believing fervently that Lima must be captured and determining that the road through Upper Peru was much too difficult, San Martín now planned to cross the Andes into Chile and then march north up the coast. The province of Cuyo just coincidentally bordered Chile.",
            "Now, back on the Atlantic coast, Buenos Aires finally emerged victorious in their struggle with Montevideo. They hired an English deserter from the Royal Navy to build them a little navy. And in June 1814, this small fleet defeated the Spanish Navy guarding the harbor of Montevideo. So finally, surrounded on both land and sea, Montevideo was forced to capitulate and put themselves under the control of those no-good bastards over in Buenos Aires. ",
            "Now, for the whole length of this second siege, José Artigas and his people had never emerged from beyond the Uruguay River and thus took no part in the victory. But once Buenos Aires had taken Montevideo, José Artigas came out and said, “Give me control of the city. I’m the only native leader of the patriotic Banda Oriental.” Buenos Aires tried to ignore Artigas and hold the city under their own direct jurisdiction. But even among allies that they had in Montevideo, there was no patience for Buenos Aires’ rule. So those guys withdrew and ceded control of the city to José Artigas, who triumphantly entered the city in the summer of 1814. Artigas then inaugurated a broadly liberal policy that specifically promoted mixed-race ranchers over the criollo elite of the city. And, oh yeah, he also abolished slavery. ",
            "Now, before we leave the Río de la Plata, we have to get through one more little leadership change in Buenos Aires because in January 1815, Posadas resigned and Alvear finally stepped into the spotlight as the supreme dictator of the Río de la Plata. But his rule was immediately unpopular. Already without a hold on Uruguay or Paraguay or Upper Peru, even cities inside of what is today Argentina, like Córdoba and Santa Fe, now revolted as well. Even his Masonic brother and ally, San Martín, was able to offer little support as he was now fully immersed in his plans to invade Chile. So on April 15, 1815, Alvear resigned in favor of yet another military strongman. And this is about as current as events were going to get as Bolívar sat in Jamaica composing his letter just a few months later. And though he pled ignorance, Bolívar knew enough to predict that Argentina would be ruled by a centralized military dictatorship that would eventually devolve into a corrupt oligarchy, you know, not too far off the mark. And though he cannot have been caught up on all the details of the Río de la Plata, to get from four viceroyalties to 15 to 17 new nations, you have to have division somewhere. And Bolívar never implied that the cohesion of the Río de la Plata would hold since there was obviously no cohesion to speak of. ",
            "From here, Bolívar then turned his attention to Chile, currently the southern province of the Viceroyalty of Peru, but destined to become an independent nation. And of Chile, he wrote, “The Kingdom of Chile is destined by the nature of its geography, by the innocent and virtuous customs of its inhabitants, by the example of its neighbors, to enjoy the blessings conferred on the just and gentle laws of the republic. If any American republic is to endure, I am inclined to believe it will be Chile.” So let’s talk about Chile.",
            "Once a ship has navigated its way through the treacherous waters around Cape Horn, it will come up and around the Pacific coast, arriving first in southern Chile and its capital of Concepción. Then further up the coast lay the Chilean capital of Santiago. And from there it would be another two weeks or so up the coast to Lima. And thanks to being on the lower back side of South America, Chile was sheltered from foreign attack, unlike the port to the Caribbean that constantly had to worry about the French or British or United States coming around. They were also far enough removed from Lima that Chile enjoyed local autonomy, and it had been mostly independent Captaincy General since almost the conquistador era. Little changed in Chile after the abdications of Bayonne. The Viceroy in Peru stayed in place. The Captain General in Chile stayed in place. But it was a different matter when the Supreme Junta fell in 1810 because the Captain General of Chile at that point just so happened to be an abusive piece of crap that nobody liked. And his response to the news that Seville had fallen was to crack down, like an abusive piece of crap that nobody liked. ",
            "So in July 1810, the Santiago audiencia, like no radical institution, actually took the lead in deposing this hated Captain General because they were worried his unpopular antics would actually trigger a revolt. The audiencia then replaced him with an octogenarian General named Mateo de Toro Zambrano. But just a few weeks later, they got hit with three pieces of news simultaneously. First, despite the fall of Seville, a new regency had been established in Spain. Second, that regency had appointed a new Captain General of Chile. And third, the boys over in Buenos Aires had already rejected the regency with their little May Revolution. And this last piece of news triggered a patriotic move for self-government in Chile. And on September 18, 1810, at an open town council in Santiago, they agreed to form an independent junta with Zambrano as president. ",
            "The Chilean Junta was the most moderate and prosperous of all the South American juntas. It scrupulously maintained its allegiance to Ferdinand, describing their every move to their brothers in Cádiz and Buenos Aires and Lima, swearing up and down that they were not republican separatists but loyal subjects of the Empire. But that said, they also prudently prepared for an inevitable expedition from Lima to bring them back into the official viceregal fold. ",
            "But the unity and prosperity of the Chilean Junta masked regional rivalries, specifically the rivalry between Santiago in the north and Concepción in the south. As the capital of Chile, Santiago tended to be more elitist and conservative, while the men in Concepción tended to be more liberal and radical. Inside the junta, this came down to a struggle between Juan Martínez de Rozas from Concepción and Juan Miguel Carrera from Santiago. And Carrera, in particular, is important. A young, rich criollo recently returned from military service in Spain. In December 1810, the junta issued a call for a general congress to convene in Santiago to draft a constitution. But when this congress convened, the first thing they tried to do was assume authority over the junta and reduce it to a weak executive branch. But a temporary alliance between Rozas and Carrera launched a coup on September 4, 1811. They purged the congress of moderates and created a new five-man executive. In the wake of this coup, Concepción then went ahead and formed its own junta on November 15th to protect their own interests, which was smart because two months later, Carrera just seized power. He dissolved the general congress without consulting his colleagues, and so, under the leadership of Rozas, Concepción refused to recognize Carrera’s authority and instead went into rebellion. ",
            "The whole of 1812 then played out as Carrera pretending to negotiate with Concepción. But really what he was doing was blockading the south, preventing all traffic from Lima and points beyond to the north from reaching southern Chile. With this done, Carrera could just afford to wait his rivals out. The southern economy tanked under the blockade, and in July 1812, Rozas was deposed and sent into exile. Now, civil war looked like the inevitable end to this conflict, but then both sides were hit with a huge stroke of luck. Kind of. The long-expected invading army from Peru finally landed in March 1813. So instead of fighting each other, the Chileans banded together to fight the invaders. The Chileans, far from being conquered, were now more united than ever. Whoopsie. ",
            "It was the landing of the Peruvians in March 1813 that brought a very important man to prominence: Bernardo O’Higgins. What Bolívar is to Venezuela, and Artigas is to Uruguay, and San Martín is to Argentina, Bernardo O’Higgins is to Chile.",
            "So, first of all, his name is pretty far out, right? I mean, O’Higgins is not the most Spanish name I’ve ever heard of, and for a good reason. Bernardo’s father was an Irishman. Irish Catholics had long sought prosperous relocation to Spanish America, where they were treated as full citizens who could freely exercise their religion, unlike life under the British. So it was that Ambrosio O’Higgins drifted into Spanish imperial service and emigrated to Chile in 1766. He worked first as an engineer and then joined the Spanish army, commissioned as a Colonel in 1777. The very next year, Colonel O’Higgins had an affair with an 18-year-old daughter of a wealthy family in southern Chile that produced an illegitimate son, little Bernardo. His birth a scandal, Bernardo was quietly handed over to arranged foster parents, and Colonel O’Higgins returned to his career, which was about to seriously take off. ",
            "But though Ambrosio O’Higgins would not recognize his son, he did make sure the boy was provided for. Bernardo was raised first by foster parents and then later by a distant friend of his father. And his father was becoming a powerful man indeed. He was promoted first to General and then intendant of Santiago, on his way to the Captaincy General of Chile itself, which he was promoted to in 1788. He was now one step below the Viceroy himself. Now, eventually, Bernardo learned who his father was, and though the two did not meet, they did keep up a distant correspondence. At the age of 15, Bernardo was sent to Lima to get a top-flight education before being forwarded back to Europe to complete his studies. But there’s a good deal of suspicion that Ambrosio wanted to get his bastard son on the other side of the world while he made his play for the viceroyalty. ",
            "So, 17-year-old Bernardo O’Higgins landed first in Spain, but he was quickly deflected up to England, where he took up residence with an upper-middle-class family in Richmond. Now, Bernardo was supposed to have an allowance of £300 a year to live on, but the local agents who held the money in trust for his father skimmed most of it away for themselves. So Bernardo wrote to his father, complaining about all this, but he never received a reply. Ambrosio was probably too busy having won his grand prize because in 1796, the Irishman Ambrosio O’Higgins became Viceroy of Peru. With his father now one of the most powerful men in the Western Hemisphere, Bernardo was basically forgotten about and then just ignored. His friends and host family had to take up collections to keep him fed and warm. ",
            "Now, given his lonely and rejected circumstances, it was natural that Bernardo O’Higgins would gravitate to the Grafton Street house in London. And it was natural that Francisco de Miranda would gravitate to O’Higgins. Miranda was very well informed and knew exactly who this boy was and, more importantly, who his father was. So Miranda arranged to become Bernardo’s tutor in math, soon branching out to history, politics, and literature. And O’Higgins became the most successful disciple of Miranda. The other Spanish American liberators, like Bolívar and San Martín, had their own complex relationships with Miranda, but for O’Higgins, this was clearly a master-student relationship. O’Higgins was one of the first initiates into the Grand Reunion Lodge, and he remained a constant presence at Miranda’s side in Grafton Street until shifts in the winds of war forced him to depart London for Spain in 1798. ",
            "Forced to take up residence in Cádiz, the once again miserable Bernardo O’Higgins was turned into an unpaid clerk in the employ of his guardian – a guardian who was not at all happy to be taking responsibility for the bastard son of the Viceroy of Peru. O’Higgins tried to join the Navy, but his illegitimate status got in the way. Then he thought about running away, but the British had everything blockaded. Then Bernardo got yellow fever at the end of 1800 and nearly died. And as if that wasn’t all bad enough, in early 1811, Bernardo O’Higgins was left nearly destitute. His connections to the traitor Miranda had finally filtered back to his father. Then, in early 1811, Ambrosio O’Higgins suffered a nearly fatal brain hemorrhage, in the aftermath of which he drafted a new will that purposefully disinherited Bernardo. But some last-minute pleading from somebody on Bernardo’s behalf, we do not know who, changed Ambrosio’s mind. And in the end, he recognized Bernardo as his son and left him control of a small estate. So in 1822, Bernardo O’Higgins returned to Chile and spent the next eight years focused on his estate, mostly vineyards and cattle, and dabbling in some local politics. ",
            "But throughout this whole period, he was also an active revolutionary Mason and an acolyte of Miranda’s dream of independence. So from the abdications of Bayonne forward, O’Higgins will always be close to the leading edge along with a few of his fellow radical southerners. O’Higgins was made a minor functionary in the junta government after independence in 1810, but he resigned in protest over Juan Miguel Carrera’s unilateral seizure of power. So he returned to the south then and would no doubt have taken a leading role in the looming civil war between Concepción and Santiago. But the arrival of the Peruvians in March 1813 changed everyone’s political calculus. As I said, the Chileans joined forces to repel the invaders, and 35-year-old Bernardo O’Higgins got his first taste of military action. All through 1813, O’Higgins won repeated skirmishes against the royalists and became a popular leader in Chile, much to the annoyance of Carrera. ",
            "On the whole, however, the war was not going great for the Chileans. And in November 1813, the junta dropped Carrera as Commander in Chief and replaced him with a guy who seemed like a winner, Bernardo O’Higgins. But given the circumstances, winning the war was a pretty tall order. And O’Higgins spent the next few months trying to rally a war effort that was short on men and short on cash, and prepared to fall back into the north-south conflict at any moment. With the unity of the Chileans once again fraying, the Viceroy in Peru helpfully sent along another invasion in January 1814 that once again fused them all back together. Carrera and O’Higgins set aside their differences, and everyone went to war, fighting off the new forces. But in June 1814, even more royalist forces arrived, and they started marching on Santiago. O’Higgins set up a defensive line with 1,700 men at the town of Rancagua, hoping to block this royalist advance, but situated in a ravine, it was not ideal for defending, and his rival/partner, José Miguel Carrera, showed no interest in rushing down to reinforce the position. So the disunity of the Chileans is ultimately what would undo them. ",
            "On October 1, 1814, thousands of royalist forces streamed into Rancagua. O’Higgins’ men fought for 30 straight hours, hoping that Carrera would come to their relief. But when Carrera did finally set out, he was routed in the field and never even came close to the city. With defenses crumbling everywhere, O’Higgins ordered a general breakout. But “general” is a pretty generous way of putting it. O’Higgins ordered his cavalry, about 500 men, to bunch together and ride fast in a column through enemy lines and then disperse, which they did. And it’s a famous and heroic moment. But though the cavalry could just ride away, the infantry couldn’t really do anything. They were just doomed. I mean, they had orders to disperse, but how? They were surrounded. So the royalists then streamed in, and they were in no mood for forgiveness. In this battle, the Chileans lost 600 dead, 300 wounded, and 400 prisoners, which, hey, kind of looks like O’Higgins’ total force minus the cavalry. Remember, kids, if you want to live, join the cavalry. ",
            "So royalist forces quickly converged and were able to take Santiago just a few days later, ending the rule of the Santiago Junta and turning this whole era from 1810 to 1814 into a discreet little Chilean historical unit called the Patria Vieja, the Old Fatherland. For the next three years, restored royalists would govern Chile. But in the wake of this reconquest, thousands of patriotic refugees streamed across the Andes into Argentina, Bernardo O’Higgins chief among them. And there they would find welcome and energetic aid from the armies of José de San Martín, who mustered emergency relief shipment for the incoming refugees, all of whom he saw as victims of despotism and ready allies for his long-planned campaign against the Spaniards. His fellow Mason, Bernardo O’Higgins, now joined the inner circle of that campaign. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "Last week, I buried you under an onslaught of information about the course of events in the Río de la Plata and Chile from 1810 to 1815, the principal upshot being that José de San Martín and Bernardo O’Higgins are currently sitting on the east side of the Andes Mountains preparing for their invasion of Chile. Now, this week, we are heading back to Venezuela to take another few spins on the revolving door that was the early revolutionary career of Simón Bolívar. But by the end of today’s episode, the spinning will stop, and he will move forward. ",
            "But I do have one small correction I need to make before we get going. When I was talking about Buenos Aires finally getting a navy so they could go take down Montevideo, I described the guy who helped them organize it as an English deserter from the Royal Navy. But this is not true. And this not true fact was caught by sharp-eared listener Colin Doyle. This guy was actually an Irishman named William Brown, to whom I profusely apologize for identifying as an English deserter because he was neither English nor a deserter. Now, he was an ex-sailor, but he emigrated to the Río de la Plata to make a living as a civilian merchant. This is all an ironic error for me to have made, given that we talked all about how well Irish could do in Spanish America in last week’s episode. So, not an English deserter, but rather Admiral William Brown, who was called the father of the Argentine Navy. And after a lifetime of service to Argentina, died a national hero in 1857 at the ripe old age of 79. So I apologize, Admiral Brown. ",
            "So back in the north, we last left Bolívar in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on New Year’s Eve 1815. And though Bolívar and his Venezuelan brothers had always feared Haitian-style racial revolution, the end result of that revolution that Bolívar witnessed in the Republic of Haiti could not have been as disastrous as Bolívar himself may have believed it would be. The coloreds and blacks lived in basic harmony. I mean, yes, the outward appearance masked deeper divides, but it’s not like Haiti was some anarchic hellscape. Sure, there were not many whites around, you know, because of like Dessalines’ genocide and whatnot, but the ports of Les Cayes and Port-au-Prince and Jacmel were all open for business, and traders from the United States and Great Britain and the Netherlands all ran a brisk trade. And it was actually these international merchant connections that acquainted Bolívar with President Alexandre Pétion, now ten years removed from his assassination of Dessalines and the establishment of a working agreement with King Henri Christophe and the Kingdom of Haiti to the north. ",
            "Bolívar met Pétion shortly after he arrived in Port-au-Prince, and the Haitian president made a distinctly favorable impression. Pétion was intelligent, erudite, he was a former General turned statesman ruling a peaceful country with a strong central hand. Basically, Pétion already was everything Bolívar was trying to be. But Bolívar also made a favorable impression on Pétion, and the two fell into an easy friendship, and no doubt spent some time discussing many of the ideas Bolívar had just laid out in a letter from Jamaica about the future history of Spanish America.",
            "Pétion also would have heard Bolívar complain about the lack of support from all the other powers. The British always prioritize their alliances in Europe and the United States kind of betrayed their status as the first independent republic in the Western Hemisphere by ignoring all pleas for aid from Spanish America. So it fell to Pétion to offer the assistance that everyone else refused to give and so it was that the second free republic in the Western Hemisphere, rather than the first, came to the rescue of their republican brothers in South America. ",
            "Pétion now saw himself as a patron of further liberation in the Americas, and he promised as much aid as he could muster for Bolívar’s cause. And this is like real stuff, not just words: 1,000 guns, 30,000 pounds of powder, and seven ships with crews to man them. He also invited his fellow citizens to join the expedition, and so Bolívar wound up with a couple hundred free black soldiers under his command. But this aid did not come without a major condition on Pétion’s part, though. Bolívar had to swear that when Venezuela was liberated, racial equality would be law and slavery would be abolished. This was now a condition Bolívar was ready to accept. ",
            "This represents a major transformation for Bolívar. Until now, he’s been an aristocratic white criollo, liberal and enlightened and all, but never quite breaking out of the world that he had been raised in. Whites on top, mixed-race in the middle, slaves, unnecessary evil. But after five years of failure, Bolívar was now primed to try a different approach. Because look where his narrow, criollo vision had gotten him: losing the First Republic to Monteverde, losing the Second Republic to the Legions of Hell, and now on the verge of losing everything to the Grand Armada of Pablo Morillo. And every time Bolívar had looked to the other side of the lines, he saw a raid against him. All the Pardos and Mestizos Indians, free blacks, and even slaves. The vast majority of the population of Venezuela had just never been with him. Why? He said all the right things, but he never showed a genuine interest in the needs of the vast majority of the population. But Bolívar was now ready to believe that he might actually have to dedicate himself to liberty and equality, true liberty and true equality, if he was going to lead Venezuela to freedom. And living in Haiti for a few months in the midst of his revolutionary crisis had to have helped convince Bolívar that it would not necessarily be the end of the world if liberty and equality were brought to Venezuela. So he accepted Pétion’s terms. ",
            "Bolívar had not come to Haiti alone. He had arrived with a small entourage of loyal officers. And while they lived in Port-au-Prince, other exiled revolutionaries gravitated towards them. By March 1816, the corps of officers included Santiago Mariño, the Liberator of the East, the Pardo colonel Manuel Piar, who had been driven away from Margarita Island by the Morillo Armada. And it’s worth remembering that the last time Piar and Bolívar were together, Piar literally tried to kill Bolívar. Also, there was one of Mariño’s generals, a guy named Francisco Bermúdez. Bermúdez had a grudge against both Piar and Bolívar, going back to the fall of the Second Republic, so he didn’t really get along with anybody. And then there was also a group of officers who had suffered through the siege of Cartagena and fled the city when it fell in December 1815, among them was Colonel Antonio José de Sucre, who was on the verge of becoming Bolívar’s most favorite protégé, but we’re not quite there yet. There were also a few foreign mercenaries in the bunch, the most prominent of whom I am probably going to have to peel off and do a full supplemental about: the always colorful confidence man/revolutionary General Gregor McGregor. Also in there was Bolívar’s Dutch merchant friend, Luis Brión, the guy who had set him up in Jamaica and who had pledged his 24 gun ship to Bolívar’s cause. ",
            "So this was a combustible group of men, to say the least. Not more than half of them were truly loyal to Bolívar. Mariño and Bermúdez and Piar considered themselves Bolívar’s allies, but not his subordinates. And what these guys really were was amongst the first generation of caudillo, a type of military political leader who would become a staple of Spanish American war and politics. Men who forged armies with their own funds, their own regional connections, and their own charismatic leadership. And when we get to the Mexican Revolution, that’s basically just going to be a decade straight of various caudillos overthrowing each other. Bolívar was not a fan of caudillo-style armies. He had said back in the Cartagena Manifesto that independence would only come with a professional standing army doing the work, though, of course, he did expect to be leading that army. ",
            "So, after a great deal of arguing and at least one duel narrowly averted, this group of Generals did agree that it needed a single leader, and they voted to make Bolívar El Jefe Supremo, Commander in Chief of the expedition. Santiago Mariño, the Liberator of the east, would be the second in command and Chief of Staff. But this command hierarchy is not really going to be worth the paper it’s written on once they all get back to Venezuela. ",
            "On March 31, 1816, Bolívar’s expedition set sail. But before they could really get underway, they had to swing by the island of St. Thomas to pick up Bolívar’s mistress, Pepita Machado. Though Bolívar kept his oath to never remarry, he was a well-known lover of women and was always able to find companionship wherever he went. Usually, these were the equivalent of today’s one-night stands. But Pepita Machado was different. She really captured Bolívar’s attention in a way that no woman had since the death of his wife. Pepita came from a criollo Caracas family, and the two met when Bolívar made his triumphant re-entrance into the city in August 1813. The two began a relationship, and this time, instead of quickly moving on, Bolívar remained captivated. Pepita and her family, which usually meant her sister and mother, began traveling with Bolívar’s entourage. But as he was preparing to leave the residence of the city on that terrible exodus to Barcelona in the summer of 1814, because the Legions of Hell were coming, Bolívar refused to let Pepita accompany him. Instead, he put her and her family on a boat out to the Caribbean islands. Pepita ultimately settled in St. Thomas, while Bolívar tried and failed to reignite the struggle for independence in New Granada. And then she stayed on St. Thomas even as he wound up in Jamaica on his way to Haiti. And it was only now that his return expedition to Venezuela was finally putting to sea that the couple made firm plans to reunite. Except that on the way to St. Thomas in early April 1816, Bolívar learned from a passing ship that Pepita, her sister, and mother had departed St. Thomas, headed for Les Cayes, trying to reach Bolívar in Haiti before he departed. Though, Bolívar ordered the fleet to drop anchor while he sent his quickest ship back to Haiti to pick her up. And then, when Pepita finally did arrive and the lovers were reunited after 18 months apart, Bolívar waited one full day, just sitting on quiet seas before ordering the fleet to move on. None of that sat particularly well with his fellow revolutionaries. But the heart wants what the heart wants. ",
            "Now, the situation in Venezuela was pretty grim in the spring of 1816. General Pablo Morillo had sailed away to begin the siege of Cartagena eight months back, leaving in charge the new Captain General of Venezuela, Francisco Tomás Morales. Morales was the General who had ridden alongside Boves in the Legions of Hell. He was the man who had lost that satchel, leading Bolívar to order the execution of a thousand prisoners in Caracas. He had also been the man to ride at the head of those 8,000 men that crushed Bolívar at Aragua – the last battle Bolívar fought before the incident with the 24 crates of treasure left him exiled once again, though, of course, luckily, having just missed Manuel Piar’s firing squad. Well, now Captain General Morales has converted some of the old Legions of Hell into a more formal cavalry arm of the royalist military. And he is currently leading a punitive government focused on rooting out all possible enemies of the state and destroying them. They set up a committee of confiscation which confiscated the property of prescribed patriots, Simón Bolívar’s name being at the top of the list. The committee wound up confiscating over a million pesos worth of property, fully 20% of which was from Bolívar. Others, identified as republicans, were placed into forced labor camps or simply executed in a town square one day. But with the population already reduced by as much as a quarter by the war to the death, it’s not like there was much more killing to be done. ",
            "Morales’ men also started running out of victims because their relentless repression had triggered an exodus of republicans from the coast into the interior grasslands, since it was the one region relatively safe from royalist reprisals. Now, the Llanos may have been where the Legions of Hell had come from initially, but remember, the Legions of Hell had never been an ideological force, right? They followed the caudillo Boves. Wherever he pointed, they rode. After his death, many remained under the leadership of Captain General Morales, but many, if not most, returned to their homes in the Llanos. The war was over. They had won. It was time to count up the booty. But now those returning veterans from the Legions of Hell were intermixing with the refugee republicans and a new mass of cowboy warriors was forming. And they were ready to accept a different version of the gospel and be pointed in a new direction. And with Morales, himself a white guy, now appearing to re-embrace the Ancien Régime which had always come with a heavy dose of racism, the llaneros who had once ridden with the Legions of Hell were now ready to switch sides and transform the war of Venezuelan independence. ",
            "Now, after the armada of Pablo Morillo had moved on, Margarita Island had been left with only a small garrison and after a few months, a small band of republicans had managed to retake it. So when Bolívar finally got the expedition moving again upon reuniting with Pepita, it was to Margarita Island that they sailed, arriving in May of 1816. Upon arrival, most of the senior officers bolted in different directions, each planning to do their own thing. Mariño, Piar, Bermúdez were all natives of the east and were simply picking up where they left off reconnecting old networks, rallying old allies, and using those long relationships they had built to raise more men. These guys were caudillos, raising personal armies. And it’s not like Bolívar wasn’t okay with it. I mean, the ability to recruit was a huge part of what those guys brought to the table. But Bolívar cannot have missed that the title, El Jefe Supremo, wasn’t much more than a title. ",
            "While everyone scattered, Bolívar himself landed troops on the eastern mainland to create a staging area for his own personal project, which was the reconquest of Caracas. When he landed in June 1816 with free black volunteer soldiers from Haiti beside him, Bolívar fulfilled his promise to Pétion and made a sweeping declaration of full liberty to the slaves who had trembled under the Spanish yoke for three centuries. Never mind that Bolívars and their fellow criollo aristocrats were the ones actually minding the yoke. As I said, this is a pretty big turning point: Bolívar’s revolution now stands for emancipation.",
            "Well, yes, it does. But as we’ll see, it’s clear Bolívar was really positioning emancipation as the ideal end state for the Republic of Colombia — an ideal state not likely to be achieved with one grand gesture but rather the gradual elimination of slavery over time. Indeed, in the coming years, even after Bolívar has gone off to Valhalla, the pace of emancipation would remain a contested issue, usually an issue won by the owners rather than the slaves. But that’s all in the future. For the moment, it’s full liberty and emancipation. ",
            "Besides ending slavery, Bolívar also issued a declaration making it clear that the war to the death was now over, that his was no longer an army of terror. Bolívar had come to realize that in the long run, punishing neutrality with death and offering no quarter to the enemy had lost far more support for the republic than it had gained. And he planned to treat civilians and prisoners of war with respect, and he swore that his senior officers would do the same. ",
            "So Bolívar is finally putting the pieces together here. He’s moved decisively towards liberty and equality, ideals that would win him support not just with aristocratic whites, but the whole population. He had abandoned the counterproductive war to the death. He’s trying to forge a single professional army out of a bunch of allied caudillos. But there was still one more blind spot he had to shake before he could finally really let it rip — his focus on Caracas. Bolívar still believed that capturing and holding the capital was the key to victory. It had been the driving thrust of the Admirable Campaign, and despite how that had turned out, Bolívar made capturing Caracas once again the driving thrust of his latest campaign. It had not yet dawned on him that he could actually make considerably more progress by focusing on everything but the capital. But fear not, the fiasco we’re about to discuss will allow Bolívar to shake that last blind spot once and for all. ",
            "Transported by the little navy now run by Luis Brión, Bolívar’s forces cruised west along the coast until they got to a beach serving the coastal city of Ocumare, which is about halfway between the royalist fortresses of Caracas and Puerto Cabello. Bolívar planned to split the royalist line and make a run at capturing Valencia, from which he would then turn and pounce on Caracas. But after landing on July 5, 1816, Bolívar never got off the beach, most likely screwed over by a messenger who had gone over to the enemy. Bolívar sent an advanced force a few miles inland to hold the city of Ocumare proper. And then those guys sent a messenger back, reporting that they were in good position. But this rogue messenger told Bolívar that Captain General Morales was on the way with 8,000 men. Suitably spooked, Bolívar sent the messenger back to scramble up a defense, whereupon the messenger reported to the forward unit that Bolívar had pulled up anchor and sailed away. With the various patriot units now full of confusion, fear, and resentment, the whole operation collapsed in pitiful fashion. Bolívar ordered all the guns and powder that had been offloaded put back on the ships. But believing Morales was right on top of them, the men refused, more interested in saving themselves than a pile of weapons. And then, I kid you not, a couple of professional pirates who had signed up as mercenaries were like, “Well, hey, there’s a bunch of guns laying around.” And with confusion raining, they loaded a pile of guns onto their own ship and just sailed away. Unable to control the situation, Bolívar did finally order a withdrawal, leaving all the Haitian guns and ammo laying on the beach or disappearing with the pirates. This was yet another embarrassing failure in the very mixed early military career of Simón Bolívar. ",
            "Retreating in defeat once again, Bolívar redeposited Pepita and her family on St. Thomas and returned to eastern Venezuela in mid-August, where he received a cold reception from the eastern caudillo generals who wondered why they needed this guy anyway. Bolívar had no native following or home connections in the east, and his expedition to the west had been a disaster. El Jefe Supremo had sailed off and lost all their guns. Meanwhile, the eastern caudillos have been recruiting and seizing control of territory. ",
            "So on August 22, 1816, they staged a coup against El Jefe Supremo. Bolívar got wind of it, tried to make a run for it, but was surrounded near the beach by an angry mob. In the midst of the resulting confrontation, General Bermúdez took out his sword and apparently made a very serious attempt to kill Bolívar right then and there but was stopped by some more level-headed guards. In the ensuing confusion, Bolívar was able to run down and get in a canoe and then paddle out to Brión’s ship, which put back out to sea to the only place that would have them—the Republic of Haiti. In early September 1816, Bolívar was back in Port-au-Prince, now a four-time exile. ",
            "Now, you may have noticed this, but the unmitigated disaster in Ocumare looks an awful lot like Francisco de Miranda’s failed Leander Expedition. And you may have also noticed that it took place almost exactly ten years apart. Miranda sailing away from his debacle on August 13, 1806, while Bolívar departed on July 14, 1816. But there was an even closer connection between the two, because on that very July 14, 1816, on the other side of the Atlantic, Francisco de Miranda breathed his last. ",
            "Now, of course, he had breathed his last free air almost exactly four years earlier after being taken into custody by Bolívar and the other bitter officers of the First Republic in 1812. Miranda had remained in custody in Puerto Cabello until Bolívar’s successful Admirable Campaign when he was put on a ship to Puerto Rico. And then shortly thereafter forwarded on to Cádiz, where he was chucked in the fortress of La Carraca. During the whole length of his final imprisonment, Miranda’s physical health deteriorated, but he never gave up hope that somehow he would get out of this alive. He maintained heavy correspondence with friends and acquaintances across Europe and the Americas, and he also inundated the Spanish government with pleas for clemency. First, these pleas were ignored by the regency, but now they were busy being ignored by the restored Bourbon monarchy. The traitor Miranda had lurked on the edges of the Spanish American Empire, trying to destroy it for over 30 years. Now he was in hand, and they were not going to let him go. ",
            "The end was not pleasant for Miranda. On March 16, he suffered a nearly fatal stroke that left him badly incapacitated. And for the next four months, his broken body struggled through periodic convulsions and exposure to various diseases that passed through the prison. His spirit never wavered, but on July 14, 1816, Bastille Day, his body finally gave up. Miranda was buried in a simple grave in the prison graveyard. But in 1875, La Carraca was torn down, and any body that had been buried in the graveyard was chucked into a mass anonymous grave. And so in that pile somewhere lies the mortal remains of the precursor Francisco de Miranda. ",
            "He never achieved his dream, he never lived to see the independence of Spanish America, but the shadow of Miranda looms over everything. He single-handedly created an international network dedicated to the project of independence — British liberals, American merchants, hell, Catherine the Great of Russia — and then among his countrymen, he had forged a single brotherhood of revolutionaries through his grand Reunion Lodge. And it was that brotherhood of revolutionaries who would see the project through to the end — Bolívar, O’Higgins, and though the two never met, José de San Martín, plus literally hundreds of others who had passed through the house on Grafton Street. The Precursor really is a fitting honorific. Other men starred in the show, but Miranda set the stage, and now he is dead. ",
            "A few months after Miranda’s death, Bolívar was once again sitting in Haiti, perhaps wondering if he was destined to wind up like old Miranda. He briefly considered giving up on Venezuela entirely. He met a revolutionary adventurer recruiting for an expedition to Mexico, and Bolívar nearly signed up. But, I mean, come on, he’s not actually going to quit Venezuela. Especially because at the end of 1816, he started receiving dispatches from the mainland that said things like the caudillo Generals are actually making very good progress in the east. Mariño and Piar, in particular, have conquered great swaths of territory. But also, while they may dislike you, they kind of hate each other even more, and their cooperation is sorely lacking. ",
            "So despite all his failures, Bolívar still seemed to be the one guy who everybody could maybe live with as El Jefe Supremo. So in this way, Bolívar is a little bit like the South American George Washington he’s often described as being: the one man who could bind them all together, except not exactly the same since Bolívar’s hold on his subordinates was never what Washington was able to muster through his own dark night that ultimately did lead to the dawn of independence. ",
            "Now, luckily for Bolívar, President Alexandre Pétion generously waved away the fact that Bolivar had lost all that stuff at Ocumare, and he agreed to outfit the Venezuelan revolutionary for a second time. So on December 21, 1816, Simón Bolívar departed Haiti, this time for the last time. When he landed in republican Venezuela, this time he would stay. He would see Venezuelan independence through to the end, then make a famous march through the mountains to liberate New Granada before turning south to make his way through Quito on his way to Peru and his destined link with José de San Martín, who was just a few weeks away himself from making his own legendary crossing through the Andes in January and February 1817. ",
            "Upon this final return to Venezuela, Bolívar wrote personal letters to each of his Generals, attempting to knit them back together. It was time for them to stop being independent caudillos and instead form a professional army of the Republic. But the Generals remained standoffish. On January 1817, Bolívar landed in Barcelona with about 400 men. But just as he was establishing himself, word came that 4,000 royalists were on the way. And unlike the deception of Ocumare, this report was accurate and so Bolívar sent quick dispatches calling for reinforcements. And though he was not happy about it one bit, Santiago Mariño decided he could not let Bolívar hang out to dry and rode to his aid. So, too, did General Bermúdez, though not happy about it either, and possibly coming to see if he could finally plant that sword in Bolívar’s heart. But when Bermúdez arrived, Bolívar appeared so genuinely grateful, I mean, so genuinely relieved, that he called Bermúdez the Liberator of the Liberator. And this flipped some switch because from this point on, Bermúdez is as loyal a General as Bolívar ever had. ",
            "But missing from this reunion was Manuel Piar, the pardo Colonel who had gone deep into the interior towards the Orinoco River, attacking the province of Guayana and approaching the regional capital of Angostura, which lay a few hundred miles up the Orinoco River.",
            "As he marched, Piar raised an army of indians, mestizos, and pardos drawn from the local population. And not only that, but shortly thereafter, Piar took control of a prosperous network of estates run by some monks that would keep his army fed and supplied almost indefinitely. So as Bolívar huddled with Bermúdez and Mariño, and Colonel Sucre is there too, he finally saw the whole board. Forget Caracas. We will march towards Guayana and the Orinoco River, link up with Manuel Piar, use our combined forces to capture Angostura, and then march west into the plains and link up with the great man that I am going to spend next week introducing you to the Centaur of the Plains, José Antonio Páez. So on March 15, 1817, Bolívar and a small group of officers set out for the Orinoco River. ",
            "General Santiago Mariño, though, did not accompany Bolívar to the Orinoco. He stayed behind near the coast, and Bolívar ordered him to march west to establish a defensive line to prevent any royalist incursions. But as soon as Bolívar was out of sight, Mariño turned east and instead marched back towards Cumaná, where he was comfortable and surrounded by a supportive population. Mariño then proceeded to ignore any further order he didn’t like, most damnably ignoring a distress call from 400 of Bolívar’s men trying to hold a fort at Barcelona. Overrun by that royalist force, the whole garrison was killed, along with hundreds of patriotic civilian sympathizers. Mariño did not lift a finger to help them. ",
            "But Bolívar was about to have more pressing problems than Mariño’s insubordination, or at least that’s how it’s going to be made out, because Bolívar was about to have to deal with the insubordination of Manuel Piar. After a string of successes leading an army he had recruited himself, Colonel Manuel Piar was not much interested in being subordinated to Simón Bolívar and his aristocratic friends. He still harbored resentment against Bolívar for the 24 crates of treasure incident three years before, and he refused to be enveloped by this serial loser who had shown no ability to recruit, organize, or lead a successful army. And now Bolívar is going to waltz up to the army Piar has recruited, organized, and led and say, “Thank you very much. Hand it over.” Not likely. Then, in mid-April 1817, as Bolívar was still making his trek towards the Orinoco, Piar fought a battle against the one real royalist garrison in the region and thrashed it at San Félix. With this royalist force defeated, the civilian peninsular and criollo inhabitants of Angostura abandoned the city, leaving it wide open for rebel occupation. ",
            "Bolívar was thrilled to hear all of this when he finally did show up at the beginning of May, and he really did say, “Thanks, good work, hand it over.” Though, he did have the good sense to make a big show of applauding Piar and promoting him from Colonel to General. But Piar clearly has no intention of actually giving way. Although, for the moment, he bided his time. ",
            "Meanwhile, down on the coast, Santiago Mariño’s insubordination was approaching intolerable levels. In early May, he spread the rumor that Bolívar had either been killed or captured up along the Orinoco. And then, on May 8, 1817, Mariño convened a congress that would allegedly serve as the government of the Third Republic. In reality, it was just ten guys in a room. But they did vote to reinstate the old federalist constitution of 1811, the one so despised by Bolívar, and then they, of course, declared Mariño El Jefe Supremo. But not everyone around Mariño supported these machinations, and about 30 of his officers quit in protest and rode off to join Bolívar, among them Colonel Antonio José Sucre, who is now on the verge of becoming Bolívar’s protégé and heir presumptive. Meanwhile, Mariño’s new government lasted exactly one day because on May 9, 1817, Mariño learned that a royalist army was approaching. He took up arms while the congress bolted, never to reconvene or be mentioned ever again.",
            "Bolívar’s reaction to Mariño’s repeated insubordination, betrayal, usurpation, is going to be anticlimactic in a very telling way, because rather than bring the hammer down on the Liberator of the east, Bolívar would eventually go out of his way to coax Mariño out of hiding and welcome him back into the army. But this leniency towards Mariño is contrasted with his harshness towards Manuel Piar because he does bring the hammer down on Piar hard. And it’s been a lingering stain on Bolívar’s reputation that when he finally decided to make an example of an insubordinate general, that he passed over all the white criollo guys and landed on the one non-white in the senior command. And I’ve seen multiple takes on this. I’ve seen arguments that Bolívar did this deliberately. I’ve seen arguments that it was an unconscious expression of his criollo racism, and also that it was just a coincidence. Whichever it was, certainly doesn’t look good for Bolívar.",
            "Now despite his resentment, General Piar had stayed in the army. But soon he started complaining that he was sick and wanted to retire from the front lines. Bolívar tried to talk him out of it, but Piar was insistent that the illness was terrible. And so finally, on June 30, 1817, Bolívar signed the order allowing Piar to retire. But as soon as he was cut loose, Piar went around telling everybody that he had just been fired because he was colored, that Bolívar and his criollo buddies were as vicious and racist as ever. And getting people to believe this story wasn’t very hard. And pretty soon, the men who had been turned over to Bolívar were defecting back to Piar. But not enough of them, and not fast enough for Piar’s insurrection to work. Bolívar was quickly alerted to Piar’s rebellion and was understandably furious. On July 23, Bolívar signed an arrest warrant and dispatched General Bermúdez to execute it. When Piar discovered Bolívar was onto him, he bolted down to Cumaná and hopefully the protection of Santiago Mariño. I mean, Piar had been among the 45 that Mariño had first led back into Venezuela three and a half years earlier. But Piar was captured and brought back to face the wrath of Simón Bolívar. ",
            "In the meantime, Luis Brión’s little fleet had sailed up into the Orinoco River in support of Bolívar’s official capture of Angostura, which came on July 17, just before Bolívar issued the arrest warrant for Piar. From this point on, Angostura becomes the republican capital of Venezuela, although today you will not find Angostura on any map because in 1846 it was renamed Ciudad Bolívar (Bolivar City). For the next few months, Bolívar and his compatriots would start setting up a real republican government in Angostura, far from any threat posed by royalist forces up on the Caribbean coast. And it was in Angostura that Bolívar dropped the hammer on Manuel Piar. Tried before a special military tribunal, General Manuel Piar was found guilty and shot. His death would long hang over Bolívar. I mean, it still does. And it certainly made it more difficult to convince everybody that he really was now for liberty and equality rather than criollo white supremacy. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "The cause of Spanish American independence was going quite well in the fall of 1817. José de San Martín had just led his army on a remarkable push through the Andes mountains, and after a brilliant campaign, had liberated Chile, and Bernardo O’Higgins had now been installed as dictator of Chile. Once Bolívar is making his approach to Peru, I’ll go back and give you a bit more of the play-by-play because it really is something, most especially because San Martín had already recognized the power of the non-criollo population, and his liberating army was almost entirely non-white. And then up north, as we saw last week, the campaigns of Bolívar and the eastern caudillos had won control of huge swathes of territory in Venezuela, and after capturing Angostura in July 1817, now had a proper capital for the still somewhat ephemeral Third Republic. ",
            "Meanwhile, on the other side, the Spanish were starting to have a hell of a time of it. Now everything had started out according to plan. Morillo had landed in Venezuela in April 1815 at the head of 10,000 men and 60 ships and easily reasserted Spanish authority. Then he had moved on over to Cartagena and captured it in December 1815. And then as Bolívar and company were returning to Venezuela in 1816, Morillo had led his men up the Magdalena River and taken Bogotá, crushing the union of New Granada and reinstalling a viceregal government. The patriotic leaders who had collaborated with Bolívar were forced to scatter, and many were captured. And President Camilo Torres, who had organized and led the Federalist Union of New Granada, was captured and executed in October 1816. And that’s to say nothing of Antonio Nariño, who’s already sitting in a jail cell back in Cádiz. ",
            "But after this nice run of initial success, things started unraveling a bit. By the time the reconquest of New Granada was wrapping up, most of eastern Venezuela had fallen back into rebel hands. And that was to say nothing of the vast expanse of the Llanos, the grasslands that stretched across the southern reaches of both Venezuela and New Granada. That wild country proved itself surprisingly resistant to Spanish authority. A small patriot army led by Colonel Francisco de Paula Santander had taken refuge in the New Granadan Llanos when the Spanish began their push into the interior in 1816. And then the Venezuelan Llanos, well, holy heck. I’m going to tell you all about that here in a second. ",
            "So here the Spanish plans stalled out. General Morillo was supposed to pacify Venezuela, then move on to pacify New Granada, and then keep moving south to Lima to complete the reintegration of the Americas into the Spanish Empire. But instead, Morillo now had to circle back to ground he had already covered. With Venezuela falling back into rebellion, Morillo led his army overland back across the border in January 1817, setting up a headquarters in Calabozo from which he could direct the re-reconquest of the Venezuelan interior, which turned out to be a grueling slog.",
            "Now, one of Morillo’s biggest problems was that his forces were slowly being depleted, both in terms of manpower and morale. He arrived in South America in April 1815 at the head of 10,000 soldiers, all well-trained veterans of the Peninsular War. But as usual, as soon as these men arrived, they started dropping dead of tropical diseases. Now, not quite at the epidemic rate of the Leclerc Expedition, but still pretty bad. And it was difficult for Morillo to then replenish his ranks because he had been told to avoid recruiting from the native population. The geniuses back in Madrid wanted a Spanish army to conquer the Americas so that there was no question about who was boss. So rather than inviting possibly loyal Americans to join the struggle, Morillo’s commanders just tried to make do with what they had and accepted attrition as a fact of life. ",
            "Now, this was not an absolute rule, and as soon as he arrived, Morillo augmented his cavalry by incorporating men from the old Legions of Hell. But those guys had already been incorporated into the royalist military structure, and it was a matter of transferring them rather than recruiting them. But even if Morillo had been allowed to go recruit, it’s not clear he would have had a ton of success in the mixed-race populations that had so consistently joined the royalists going all the way back to Monteverde’s campaigns against Miranda, because things have now flipped. The royalists now stand for a re-entrenchment of the old colonial order with all the racist baggage that came with it, while Bolívar and his fellow republicans now proclaimed liberty and equality. So by the fall of 1817, the energy and momentum seemed to be with the patriots. And, oh, by the way, General Morillo, now headquartered in Calabozo, is routinely sending requests back to Madrid asking to be relieved of his command, please. ",
            "Simón Bolívar, meanwhile, was situated on the other side of Venezuela on the Orinoco River in the city of Angostura. Now mostly recognized as El Jefe Supremo, Bolívar spent the last few months of 1817 trying to cement a professional military structure for the armies of the Republic, to take the personal armies of the caudillos and merge them into a single apparatus with a single chain of command, and everybody divided up into armies and divisions and brigades and battalions on down the line, and Bolívar at the top as Commander in Chief. At the end of September, he created a standing general staff to ensure continuity of strategy, tactics, and logistics. To maintain discipline in the ranks, he formalized a network of courts-martial to cut down both on arbitrary punishments handed down by commanders and men escaping punishment for crimes, abuses, and disobedience. ",
            "Bolívar also created a tribunal that would regulate the seizure and distribution of captured property. Up until now, the spoils of war had been distributed by the caudillos to their men. But Bolívar now centralized the process under a tribunal who would assume authority over all the plunder. The profits would mostly go to cover the expenses of the army. I mean, wages, provisions, armaments, they all needed to be paid for somehow. Anything left over would then be directed towards the burgeoning civilian government, which for the moment was a council of state that had been established by Bolívar in Angostura. Really, it was just a small committee of civilian and military leaders who El Jefe Supremo Bolívar turned to for advice. But that was all they could offer. Advice. El Jefe Supremo made all the final decisions. ",
            "Then, to further strengthen his army, Bolívar also initiated a program that would introduce a whole new element into the struggle for independence: foreign mercenaries. Up until now, individual adventurers had been popping in and out of the picture, but Bolívar now envisioned something bigger, more systematic, and hopefully more overwhelming. To launch this program, he wrote back to his old friend Luis López Méndez in London. Now, you’ve probably forgotten all about Luis López Méndez, but he was one of the three ambassadors the First Republic sent to London in the summer of 1811, the other two being Andrés Bello and Bolívar. Well, after Bolívar returned to Venezuela, the other two men stayed behind in London and lived in the house on Grafton Street. And that is where López Méndez still was in 1817, acting as an all-purpose ambassador and trade consul and booster of republican Venezuela. ",
            "Now, over the past six years, López Méndez had done what he could to support the cause from London, and most especially, that meant purchasing arms and supplies when and where he could. And after 1815, he started having a much easier time of it because with Waterloo come and gone, the British army had excess stockpiles just sitting around that had to go somewhere, and guys like López Méndez could come round and get, like, used tents and boots or whatever at cut-rate prices. At the end of 1817, Bolívar now asked López Méndez not just for supplies, but for men. He wanted veteran British soldiers to come fight for Spanish American independence. So López Méndez got started with the help of paid recruiters and then also men with military ambitions of their own, looking to raise personal legions to go out and conquer in South America. And as you’d expect, these guys painted a picture of Venezuela full of happy little trees and happy fluffy clouds. It’s a beautiful, fertile land, just waiting for some enterprising chap to recognize a golden opportunity when he sees it, to achieve fame and fortune in an exotic land. Besides the war itself is nearly won and all you’re going to have to do is show up, kick out the last few degenerate Spaniards, and then you’ll live like a king. This was all very enticing. ",
            "Now, if potential recruits were veterans, they were promised higher pay and a bump in rank. Captains would be Colonels, Colonels would be Generals. Now, it used to be pretty common to describe all of these guys as veterans of the recently ended Napoleonic Wars. Soldiers who had been discarded along with all those tents and boots and were now just kind of loitering around looking for something to do. But more recent research has shown that this was not really the case. Maybe 30% of the recruits had at some point served in the British army, but the rest had likely never fired a gun in their lives, and they were more attracted by the promise of establishing a profitable colonial estate than the glory and plunder of battle. Now, a lot of guys did claim to be veterans who really just wandered in off the street, and not many questions were ever asked about their service records because the point was to sign up as many men as possible and put them on a boat before they changed their minds. And more than a few of these guys woke up with a vicious hangover to discover that they were in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on their way to Venezuela. ",
            "Now, in all, somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000 men made the trip across the Atlantic to fight in the wars of Spanish American independence. About half of them were Irish, a quarter English, and then the rest a mix from across Europe – Scottish, French, German, Dutch, Italian, what have you. Wars have always been a multicultural affair. Now, this 6,000 or 7,000 men did not all depart at the same time. That number covers all of the expeditions that sailed from 1817 to about 1825 when the wars wound down, though most of them had departed by 1819 when the British government tried to put a stop to all this by passing a law forbidding British citizens from serving in the Spanish Americas. ",
            "That 6,000 or 7,000 also does not represent the total number of men who actually fought in the wars that they were being shipped off to. From the minute the ships left port, the steady attrition began. Men got sick on the ships and did not survive the crossing. At least one ship sank in route. Many who did make it across contracted some tropical disease and died practically as soon as they landed. And a bunch more quickly realized that they had been lied to by the recruiters about almost everything. There were no wages, there were very few provisions, and the terrain was not full of happy little trees and fluffy clouds, but rather enormous crocodiles and poisonous snakes who, yes, reduced their ranks still further. ",
            "So now the sick and malnourished would-be legionaries began deserting in earnest. To all told, about a third of those who signed up either died or deserted before they got within 100 miles of battle. But that said, the rest would go on to fight and occasionally play critical roles in the further campaigns of Spanish American independence, most especially the famous British legion, who will fight with Bolívar. On more than one occasion, companies of foreign mercenaries fought heroically to the last man and at least 1,800 would die in service to the cause of Spanish American independence. Most of the survivors would return home at the end of the wars and so of the nearly 7,000 men who signed up, most with dreams of New World riches, only about 500 actually lived that dream and stayed in Spanish America after independence had been won. ",
            "So the first wave of foreign legionaries finally started straggling up the Orinoco River in early 1818. But by then, Bolívar had already moved on from Angostura, and after his few months of relative calm, was returning to the tumults of war. With the eastern provinces settled and a command structure in place for the military, allegedly anyway, Bolívar felt secure enough to make the critical connection of the war of Venezuelan independence, because as the expedition Bolívar had led back to Venezuela from Haiti in 1816 took up the war in the east, out in the western Llanos, a short, stocky illiterate 26-year-old cowboy was arguably doing more to break the Spaniards than all of the eastern caudillos put together. And as he racked up victories, his legend grew. And as his legend grew, his legions grew. So it was clear that the most crucial part of Bolívar’s grand plans for final victory was bringing this man into the fold. And so it is time to bring this man into the fold. Let’s talk about José Antonio Páez.",
            "José Antonio Páez was born in 1790 in a small village in the Venezuelan interior. His father was of Canary Island stock and held a minor government post, but the family was poor, and young José was just one of a pile of children. He never received a proper education. He could not read or write. British officers later claimed that they had to teach him what a fork was and how to use it. And who knows what would have happened to Páez had his life stayed on a normal trajectory? Most likely, he lives and dies in obscurity. But his life did not stay on a normal trajectory because at the age of 15, José Antonio Páez killed a man. ",
            "Now, I’ve heard a few versions of the story, and it’s one of those things that gets all wrapped up in myth and legend. But the most famous account was that he had been given some money to head into town and make some necessary purchases and then come home. But on the way home, he was jumped by some highwaymen. In the ensuing standoff, Páez shot and killed one of the would-be thieves. But now implicated in a murder, the teenage Páez elected to skip town rather than take his chances with the authorities. And so, like so many other refugees, escapees, and runaways from civilized society, Páez wound up deep in the Llanos trying to forge a new life for himself. The teenage Páez caught on at a ranch managed by a huge black slave named Manuelote, which roughly translates as Big Manuel. Manuelote took the boy on as an apprentice and taught him the cattleman’s trade how to ride, how to break wild horses, how to wrangle cattle, how to care for animals, how to endure the bugs, how to live off the land. But it was a hard apprenticeship. Manuelote was strict and unforgiving. As I mentioned earlier, racial roles out in the Llanos were pretty upside down. And so the light-skinned Páez, dubbed the Fair Páez by those around him, practically became the slave of a slave. Every night, Páez had to wash Manuelote’s feet and then rock the big man to sleep in his hammock. After three years of this, Manuelote was ordered to a neighboring estate to help with some cattle branding, and he took Páez along with him. And the owner of that estate took a liking to Páez. And here, no doubt being the Fair Páez, helped the young man catch the attention of the criollo owner. So Páez stayed on that estate and became a trusted agent before being set up with a herd of cattle of his own to go make his way in the world as an independent operator. So in 1810, at the age of 20, Páez got married and settled into what was presumably going to be a long life as a marginally prosperous cattle rancher. ",
            "But, of course, 1810 is when everything went bonkers in Spanish America. After the people of Caracas expelled Captain General Emparán, Páez was recruited into a cavalry company led by his old patron. But the Llanos was nowhere near the center of the action. So after the Declaration of Independence in July 1811, Páez did not really participate in any of the subsequent military campaigns, as Miranda gave way to Monteverde in 1812, and then as Monteverde gave way to Bolívar in 1813. After three years of service, Páez had risen to the rank of sergeant but decided that he had had enough and was granted an indefinite leave of absence just as Bolívar was beginning the Admirable campaign. ",
            "But not long after the establishment of the Second Republic, the Llanos became a hotbed of royalism. I mean, this is just as Boves is raising what will become the core of the Legions of Hell. So Páez was recalled to service, but now at the order of a royalist commander. Now, Páez was a patriot, though, and so after duly reporting and being commissioned to Captain, Páez asked for a few days leave to prepare for the campaign and just never came back. Instead, he joined a small company of patriotic llaneros who operated well away from the marauding armies being raised by Boves. When the Legions of Hell really got going in early 1814 and then rode north to take on Bolívar, Páez and his small band stayed behind in the Llanos to continue their own little rear guard guerrilla war. ",
            "Páez and his compatriots took the fall of the Second Republic and the arrival of Pablo Morillo’s Armada in stride and just kept fighting, soon discovering that the combination of the death of Boves and the influx of republican refugees into the Llanos in 1815 was swelling their ranks considerably. And though Páez was at this point an inconsequential junior officer, he had stumbled onto something resembling ambition and started swearing that he could raise an army as mighty as the now-disbanding Legions of Hell. And he turned out to be right. By the time Pablo Morillo’s armada was disembarking for Cartagena at the end of 1815, Páez was leading 1,000 men, all of them expert riders, immune to hardship, well-trained in guerrilla tactics, and able to operate independently with only the vaguest of instructions. With the rest of the patriot forces now either destroyed or in exile, by 1816, José Antonio Páez was leading practically the only organized republican army in all of Venezuela. And more than that, he was winning battles and exhausting the supposedly victorious Spaniards.",
            "By now, Colonel Santander had moved down into the far western Llanos over on the other side of the border in New Granada, and he recognized how successful Páez was being. So in September 1816, Santander made a trip over to congratulate Páez, but most especially to bring him under Santander’s overall command. Still carrying a commission from the now-defunct Union of New Granada, Santander was under the impression that he outranked Páez, which turned out to really not be the case. And when it came out that Santander expected to displace Páez as chief, Páez’s men got awfully unruly. Páez told Santander, as a matter of fact, that if he wanted to get out of this camp alive, he better acknowledge that Páez was actually the supreme leader of the Llanos. So Santander left, and Páez remained boss.",
            "So, more than anything else, it was the successes of Páez, even more than those of the eastern caudillos, that brought General Morillo back to Venezuela in January 1817. And as soon as he arrived, Morillo discovered just how treacherous fighting against Páez could be. He dispatched 4,000 men, all experienced veterans of the Peninsular Wars, to go catch the Llanos’ outlaws, and instead, they walked into Páez’s most famous victory. Leading just 1,100 men against the 4,000 Spaniards, Páez approached the Spanish camp at night and had his men kick up a stifling cloud of dust. With the Spanish in sudden confusion, Páez’s cowboys then charged in and drove the Spaniards backwards to a supposedly defensible position. But as soon as they had settled in, Páez unleashed his next trick. He ordered the dry grasslands lit on fire, and that created a wall of smoke and dust and ash. And then he ordered his men to ride straight at the Spanish through this fiery haze, crashing on top of them with a relentless series of charges until the Spanish could take it no more. These hardened veterans of the Peninsula War had just been smoked by a thousand Venezuelan cowboys. It was a major victory for Páez and it helped his legend grow even further. And they were now calling him the Lion of the Apure – the Apure being one of the principal river systems of the Llanos. They also called him the Centaur of the Plains.",
            "His thousand men ballooned possibly tenfold after this victory, and though Morillo continued to try to launch pacification incursions into the Llanos, there was very little to be done, and he later admitted that the whole enterprise was utterly demoralizing. And oh yeah, Morillo is continuing to send in his request to be relieved of his command.",
            "By the time Bolívar was relanding in Venezuela in early 1817, it was well known that this man, Páez, the Lion of the Apure, was kicking ass out in the west, and it would ultimately be essential for the two branches of the patriotic cause to work together. But it would be another year before that connection could be made. Bolívar had to first head southeast into Guayana and then come up the Orinoco to Angostura in July, and then solidify the patriot hold on the eastern provinces. But by December 1817, Bolívar and Páez were exchanging letters, and they agreed to meet the following month to come to an agreement. So Bolívar departed Angostura on New Year’s Eve 1817 at the head of 3,000 men. And over the next 20 days, they traveled 250 miles up the Orinoco River and then out onto the plains for his fateful meeting with the Centaur of the Plains. ",
            "Bolívar’s goal was obviously to do what Santander had been unable to do: to get Páez to recognize him as El Jefe Supremo. But you might at this point be asking yourself, why would Páez do that? And indeed, Páez was very skeptical of this man Bolívar. Páez knew him by reputation, but of course, that reputation is not exactly great. Bolívar has won some great victories, sure, and he’s obviously committed to the cause, but he kind of always winds up in exile. And that was to say nothing of the general llaneros’ disdain for soft criollo aristocrats of whom Bolívar was surely one.",
            "And so it came as much of a surprise to Páez as anyone else that when this little dandy rode up with his immaculate uniform and starched white shirt reeking of cologne on January 30, 1818, Páez found himself liking Bolivar quite a bit. As we’ve seen, Bolívar possessed a disarming charm. He did not come off as imperious and arrogant but rather as an easy-going, down-to-earth soldier who was as immune to personal hardship as the llaneros themselves. And over the course of their time together, most of the cowboys came to respect Bolívar quite a bit, and he was quick to join in any feats of strength or physical challenges that the men amused themselves with in camp. He managed once, after a few tries, to run up on a horse and vault himself from its rear over the horse’s head. On another occasion, he accepted a challenge to outswim a man with his hands tied behind his back, which he did. Bolívar, as it turned out, was not a soft aristocrat. And then, most impressively of all, almost impossibly, it turned out that Simón Bolívar could outride them. He could ride longer and farther than any of them. And the llaneros soon gave him the greatest compliment that they could muster. They started calling him Iron Ass.",
            "But that would all unfold over the next few months. At this first meeting, it was Bolívar’s words more than his actions that won Páez over. And the Lion of the Apure came to believe that Bolívar, with all his education, erudition, and worldly experience, was a better Commander in Chief for the patriot armies than a humble, illiterate cowboy like himself. Plus, Bolívar did not come with nothing in hand. With royalists controlling the northern coast, the inhabitants of the Llanos had lost their ability to export their meats and hides. And as a result, their economy had long been crippled. But Bolívar now controlled Angostura and the Orinoco River and promised the suffering llaneros an outlet for their exports. Now, Páez would never become a hardcore Bolivarian, but he did agree to call Bolívar El Jefe Supremo and let Bolívar take the lead in the next stage of the campaigns. ",
            "That next stage would unfold over the course of the first half of 1818 and lead many to believe that Páez, not Bolívar, really should be El Jefe Supremo. Bolívar always had grand plans, and now he wanted to overrun all of Venezuela and push into New Granada to liberate their brothers in the east. Feeding this particular vision was Colonel Santander, who had written to join Bolívar and Páez when he heard that they were meeting. He begged them to help him reinvade New Granada, and this, of course, Bolívar was ready to do. But Páez was and would remain unconvinced. He would remain thoroughly resistant to the idea of leaving the Llanos behind. His men were plainsmen, and they would lose all their advantages in the mountains.",
            "But the liberation of New Granada was now no longer the end of Bolívar’s dreams. He had even bigger dreams, because reports by then had reached him that José de San Martín had been victorious in Chile and was planning an invasion of Peru. Bolívar wanted in on that action. ",
            "But all three men could agree that the first stage would be marching on General Morillo’s headquarters at Calabozo and clearing the Spaniards out of the Llanos. Páez contributed 1,000 of his best men to the expedition, bringing the whole army up to about 4,000. And they all rode together, leading to a famous little moment that I cannot resist telling you about.",
            "When they reached the Apure River, they came across a small flotilla of armed Spanish boats. Bolívar said, “Well, what are we going to do about this?” And Páez said, “Oh, don’t worry about it. I’ll go take care of it.” And before Bolívar could respond, Páez led 50 riders on a mad charge into the river, straight at the boats. The crews were so surprised that they abandoned the boats and fled. And when you read about this incident, it is often described as the only successful cavalry attack on armed boats in military history. But we know better because way back in Episode 3.40, I told you about that time that the French cavalry charged across the frozen harbor in Den Helder to capture the Dutch navy on January 23, 1795. Now, at the time, I asked if anybody out there could dispute the claim that that was the only time in military history that ships had been captured by a cavalry charge. I’d love to hear it. But when I said that, I did not yet know the details of this incident with Páez. So you can just consider this me disputing myself. It never pays to say first or last or only when you’re talking about history because there’s always something else lurking out there.",
            "Anyway, the combined Patriot army soon had Calabozo surrounded, and Bolívar offered to let Morillo surrender, you know, if he wanted to. But as much as Morillo wanted to go home, he was not going to give up. So on a moonless night, Morillo led his men out of town before the patriots caught wise. They then made their way towards Valencia, with Morillo issuing frantic orders to Caracas for all royalist forces to converge there.",
            "Now, Bolívar wanted to pursue them, but Páez thought it too reckless. He said, “No, we need to finish the job here in the Llanos and go take San Fernando, the one major royalist base left in the grasslands.” Now, Bolívar was annoyed at this suggestion and believed that Páez wasn’t interested in the grand plan so much as securing the whole of the Llanos for himself. But not wanting to make this a test of leadership, Bolívar gave Páez leave to go besiege San Fernando.",
            "Meanwhile, Bolívar himself refused to just sit around and wait. So he marched in the direction of Valencia, but he did not plan to attack Valencia directly. Instead, he envisioned a pretty crazy plan to march up through the low mountains that separated the plains from the coast and attack the Caracas garrison before it could link up with Morillo at Valencia. Now, this was nuts, especially without support from Páez. But Bolívar went ahead and did it anyway. He led his men up into the same hills where the forces of the Second Republic had battled the Legions of Hell, even stopping to camp at Bolívar’s now-ruined San Mateo estate, where he had once spent a month under siege at the beginning of 1814.",
            "But that was as far as Bolívar got. While at San Mateo, he learned that Morillo had left Valencia and was headed straight for him. So Bolívar broke off his approach on Caracas and instead retreated. Now, he planted a rear guard to cover the escape while the rest of his men tried to make it back to the Llanos. But they soon enough found themselves at La Puerta, where twice before republican forces had been crushed. And there the royalists hit him, and at the third Battle of La Puerta, made it a dismal hat trick for the Republican army. Bolívar’s forces were hit flush and blasted out of the water. Once again, leaving a thousand dead on the field, Bolívar fled back to Calabozo with just a handful of men.",
            "When Páez found out about the defeat, he was like, “Well, yeah, what did you think was going to happen?” And subordinates started whispering in his ear that, you know, he really ought to be running this thing, not Bolívar. And over the next few months, Bolívar would be leading just a few hundred men, hardly a grand army worthy of the title El Jefe Supremo. But though you could fault his recklessness, you could not fault his resiliency. And Bolívar kept fighting. He always kept fighting. And now he was running an aggressive guerrilla campaign on the edges of the Llanos, where the hills rise up towards the steep heights of the northern Andes, across which Bolívar wanted to go, if only he could. In the midst of this campaign, he dodged his second major assassination attempt after royalist soldiers managed to beat the password out of a captured patriot. Bolívar only woke up because his mule was startled by the approaching assassins. So the bullet meant for his head missed. In the confusion, the assassins got away, but as usual, Bolívar, lucky Bolívar, caught another break.",
            "But this campaign was going nowhere fast, and across Venezuela, the gains of 1816 and 1817 were being reversed. Calabozo was retaken by royalists. Even Páez had to fall back to the relative safety of his home territory around Barinas. So in mid-1818, Bolívar decided to take a little break to take advantage of the fact that he did now have a secure capital and a refuge back at Angostura. When he reached the republican capital, though, he was inundated with complaints from the recently arrived foreign mercenaries. “Where are the wages? Where is the glory? Where is the food that we can actually eat?” He tried to placate them, but he didn’t really have any answers. López Méndez had promised money that Bolívar didn’t have, and so Bolívar disingenuously claimed that they were supposed to have been paid before they departed. But that would all get worked out, and these guys would eventually serve under Bolívar, because you do have to remember the old rule: always pay your mercenaries in full.",
            "So this now is the moment where you might expect Bolívar to be on the verge of his fifth exile. But remember, he is done being exiled. Though the outlook was grimmer than he would have liked, the royalist forces did not have the ability to dislodge him from the Orinoco River. And so, instead of exile, Bolívar hunkered down. He spent the back half of 1818 living in Angostura, occasionally heading out on inspection tours of the territory controlled by republicans, though occasionally finding that his forces held less territory than they had the last time he checked. Morale was low, though, and the whole project did seem to have stalled out. So, as usual, Bolívar just dreamed an even bigger, more impressive dream, like Wile E. Coyote deciding that the only way to make it to the other side of the gorge was to just run faster. So he started plotting an invasion of New Granada, as audacious an invasion as he would ever plan. And he’s had his share of audacious plans.",
            "By the end of 1818, there had been enough of a reprieve that Bolívar could train and organize some forces and then also come to some sort of terms with the foreign legion so that they would actually fight for him. But before Bolívar departed on this latest mad offensive, he wanted to make a grand gesture because it felt like the eyes of the world were now upon him. And quite literally, they were. Both the United States and Great Britain had sent representatives to investigate how real this independent Republic of Venezuela was and whether it might actually be worth supporting. Remember, this is right on the eve of the Monroe Doctrine, so foreign policy attitudes in the United States are starting to shift. Unfortunately, there wasn’t really a Republic of Venezuela to speak of. There was the army and the Council of State, but that is hardly going to impress foreign emissaries. ",
            "So on February 15, 1819, Bolívar convened the Congress of Angostura, 26 delegates representing not just Venezuela but also ambitiously New Granada. And they all now claimed to be the sovereign government of Colombia, an independent nation that covered the whole of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada, from Guayana to Quito. It was an empty declaration, of course, but it did fit with Bolívar’s grand vision and his latest grand plan. And if that latest grand plan succeeded, then the reality would soon line up with the fantasy.",
            "The principal purpose of the Congress of Angostura, though, was to allow Bolívar to formally give up the political power he had wielded as El Jefe Supremo since taking up residence there in July 1817. So at the opening of the Congress, Bolívar delivered a speech declaring that his time as political dictator was at an end and that he now transferred that power to the Congress. Not only was it unbecoming of a real republic to have a military dictator, but the longer he stayed in power, the harder it would be to ultimately disentangle him from it, which was his professed aim. But in this way, Bolívar was a lot like Oliver Cromwell, constantly trying to give up power, invest it in some sort of representative institution, and yet always winding back up with the scepter in hand.",
            "So Bolívar opened up the Congress on February 15, 1819, with an address called now the Angostura Address, which is the third of the great Bolivarian statements of political purpose. And in it, he recapitulated many of the same themes he had been working out since the Cartagena Manifesto: that federalism would fail in the Spanish Americas because the Spaniards had saddled them under the triple yoke of ignorance, tyranny and vice. He said that the Spanish Americans must adapt their own institutions to fit their own population to create the greatest good for the greatest number of citizens, a theory now amalgamating Montesquieu and Jeremy Bentham.",
            "He also reiterated his argument that the Americans were a new species, neither Indian nor European, but a combination, though he did now introduce a new twist: embracing liberty and equality. He finally included the African element as an essential feature of the new American race. He said, ",
            "“The European has mixed with the American and the African, and the African has mixed with the Indian and with the Europeans, all born in the womb of our common mother.” ",
            "And then he literally begged for the abolition of slavery. He said, ",
            "“I beg the confirmation of absolute freedom for the slaves, just as I would beg for my life and for the life of the Republic.” ",
            "So Bolívar does now see the whole population together and is not just focused on one sliver of it.",
            "But the Angostura Address was not just Bolívar offering abstract advice, that wasn’t really his thing. And really, it was an explanation for the draft constitution Bolívar had written and now presented to the Congress to debate and hopefully adopt. ",
            "Bolívar said that he believed that the British system provided the best working model with a combination of commons, lords, and king, though he did see their roles to be played differently. For one thing, he was a republican, so a president would stand in for the king. And further, he believed that the president should have more power than a British king, that a weak executive had been a major problem for their run of failed republics so far that had been built around juntas and congresses and triumvirs. So Bolívar implored the Congress to create a strong central executive power that would be wielded by a single man, not without checks and balances, but also not powerless. To the lower house, who would be the tribunal of the people, he assigned all the legislative functions, but critically, not the power to execute laws, that would be the purview of the president.",
            "But at the heart of Bolívar’s government was a hereditary senate standing in for the House of Lords. This body, he said, was the soul of the Republic and would, quote, “be the pillar supporting the edifice of political and civil rights.” He dismissed the idea that the Senate would become some out of touch aristocracy and instead argued that they would act to simultaneously moderate the intemperate general will and curb the authority of a power-hungry executive. He said that the Senate would be the mediator that would calm the storms and maintain harmony between the members and the head of this political body.",
            "Now, whether the Senate would have been a bulwark of freedom and the nucleus to perpetuate the Republic, as Bolívar believed it would be, we’ll never know because it was never going to be put into effect. But given that I’m currently writing a book about the failure of the Roman Senate to do just that, well, I’m skeptical of its long-term viability.",
            "Bolívar wrapped up his address by hammering home his key point: that unity, unity, unity must be the national motto, but also that it was time for them to forge that unity without him. He would remain Commander in Chief of the army, but his time as political dictator was now at an end. “Gentlemen,” he concluded, “begin your work. Mine is done.”",
            "It should come as no surprise that his work was not done, and like Cromwell before him, Bolívar would find himself dragged back into politics over and over again. But for now, he did plan to depart Angostura to return to the simple and straightforward life of a soldier. And next time, he will launch the greatest military campaign of his career, greater even than the Magdalena campaign or the Admirable campaign."

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "We left off last time with Simón Bolívar convening the Congress of Angostura in February 1819 and setting it to work drafting a constitution for what they all called the Republic of Colombia. A republic that they claimed covered all of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada. And for the moment, this was a laughably grandiose proclamation. The Republic as such was little more than a loosely knit together collection of armies led by quarrelsome caudillos, entering into a rickety chain of command, with a headquarters tucked away deep in the Venezuelan interior. Caracas and the Venezuelan coast remained in royalist hands, and the entirety of New Granada continued to live under a restored viceregal regime that had been in place since General Pablo Morillo had arrived way back in 1816. But despite the apparent fantasy of it all, Simón Bolívar was about to audaciously bend reality to fit the fantasy. Gran Colombia would be a thing. Of that, for some reason, Bolívar was positive. ",
            "Despite Bolívar’s closing statement to the Congress that his work was done, one of the first things the Congress did was elect Bolívar President of the Republic. But everybody understood that he would focus almost exclusively on the war, and the actual business of civilian government would be left in the somewhat capable hands of a long-exiled New Granadan intellectual named Francisco Antonio Zea. Now, Zea is an interesting guy who’s actually been around quite a bit, and he offers a different perspective on the events that we’ve covered so far. So before we head back out to war with Bolívar, let’s go back and do Francisco Antonio Zea. ",
            "At 53 years old, Zea was positively ancient compared to his fellow revolutionaries. Bolívar himself was still just 35. Santiago Mariño was 31. José Antonio Páez was just 29. Santander was 27. Born in New Granada shortly after the revolt of the Comuneros, Zea started in seminary, but his liberal curiosity got the better of him, and he moved to Bogotá to study secular law. He emerged from university in 1789 as a professor of philosophy, but his liberal curiosity then landed him in big trouble. He was a member of that little enlightened social circle that surrounded Antonio Nariño, and when Nariño published the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1794, Zea was amongst those arrested, and he was shipped off back to Spain, where he spent two years in the same Cádiz prison that would eventually swallow the bones of Francisco de Miranda 20 years later. Zea was paroled in 1796 and then pardoned in 1798, but the authorities barred him from returning to the Americas. So, trapped in Europe, Zea’s curiosity then took him in a scientific direction, and he got himself appointed to a scientific mission to France in 1799.",
            "So arriving in France on the eve of Bonaparte’s coup of Brumaire, Zea witnessed firsthand the hopeful dawning of an enlightened end to the chaos of revolution. And he became an admirer of Bonaparte and a confirmed Francophile, seeing in the French the polar opposite of the medieval ignorance of the Spanish. He finally returned to Spain in 1803, and now a somewhat renowned scientist and intellectual, Zea was appointed head of the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid. But his French connections and worldview were very strong now. And when the abdications of Bayonne hit in 1808, Zea was one of the 85 deputies selected by Napoleon to rubber-stamp the transfer of power to Joseph Bonaparte. Zea was then rewarded with a provincial governorship, and he loyally served the French regime until the end. So through the whole of the Peninsular War, Zea was on the other side. When Napoleon’s Empire started imploding in 1814, Zea fled back to France. ",
            "Instead of remaining in Europe, though, for the final collapse of Imperial France, Zea decided it was time to return home after 20 years of exile. Now I lose track of him for a little bit, and I’m not sure where exactly he landed, but the next time I can nail him down is 1816 when he shows up in Haiti to join Bolívar’s little band of revolutionary caudillos who were gathering under the patronage of Alexandre Pétion. So Zea was amongst those who traveled back with everybody to Venezuela in March of 1816. ",
            "But Zea was an intellectual, not a soldier. So though he was respected, he was not exactly a force to be reckoned with in a company where the number of scars you had counted for more than the number of books you had read. But he was also something of an acceptable neutral party between all the caudillos. And after Bolívar had been sent back into exile following his disaster at Ocumare, Zea was the one who made the trip back to Haiti at the end of 1816 to tell the Liberator, “Come back. We actually do still need you.” ",
            "After Bolívar and company successfully captured Angostura in the summer of 1817, Zea was then dispatched on a mission to London to assist in the recruitment of British legionaries, and so he was amongst those running around painting happy little trees for would-be recruits. But then rumors started filtering back home that Zea was overstepping his bounds, taking out unauthorized loans, and possibly embezzling money. So Bolívar recalled him to Angostura. But obviously, there were no hard feelings because upon his return, Bolívar made Zea an editor-in-chief of a new patriotic newspaper that had been started to promote the Republic. And that was the job that Zea held until his election to Vice President of the Republic in February 1819, which, as it would turn out, was an office worth quite a bit more than a bucket of warm spit. Because when Bolívar rode off to resume his grand war of liberation, Zea became the de facto president of the Republic. But though there was something pleasantly respectable about a civilian running the government, it would not be long before the caudillos, who even Bolívar had trouble keeping in line, would begin looking sideways at the bookworm in Angostura telling them how to do their jobs. Especially once the rumors started filtering back that Simón Bolívar was dead. ",
            "After issuing some final instructions to the eastern caudillos, Mariño and Bermúdez and those guys, Bolívar gathered up a company of about 300 newly arrived British legionaries and headed west up the Orinoco River in the direction of the western Llanos and the army of José Antonio Páez. Now, the relationship between Páez and Bolívar was critical to the success of the revolution, but that relationship was complicated. Páez was simultaneously deferential and insubordinate. He continued to act like Bolívar’s orders were mere recommendations to be taken under advisement. But he did not budge from his belief that Bolívar was the right man to be El Jefe Supremo. So, for example, in the summer of 1818, after Bolívar had returned to Angostura following his disastrous attempt to take Caracas, that was all the stuff we talked about last time, elements in Páez’s command, most especially a few of the newly arrived British officers, tried to orchestrate a coup to make Páez El Jefe Supremo and send Bolívar to his fifth and hopefully final exile. But Páez wouldn’t have it. And at Bolívar’s order, he tossed the principal British agitator in jail and then deported him from the country. ",
            "So though Páez took Bolívar’s orders under advisement, he did follow them when he agreed with the orders. And after departing for Angostura, Bolívar ordered the Lion of the Apure to avoid any major battles with General Morillo’s royalist army until Bolívar came back, and Páez complied. He followed this order even as Morillo marched on Páez’s headquarters in the city of San Fernando. Refusing to fight but also refusing to let Morillo take the city, Páez ordered San Fernando burned to the ground and then withdrew with his men out into the open plains. Morillo later said that when he saw the flames rising from San Fernando, he pretty much lost all hope of ever winning the war. How do you fight an enemy that simply does not care about living naked out in the wilderness if they have to? Páez then continued to avoid any set engagements while harassing Morillo mercilessly with guerrilla attacks. And the only thing Morillo really has going for him here is that he was a veteran of the Peninsular War, and so he was well acquainted with guerrilla tactics, and he had some idea how to deflect them. He kept his men together, he prevented anyone from getting isolated. He maintained strong defensible positions and tried not to take any obvious bait. But it was hard, and it was demoralizing, and it was exhausting. And General Morillo’s request to be relieved continued apace. ",
            "So those things were going according to his instructions, when Bolívar reached Páez’s headquarters finally in March 1819, his first question was, “Where do you and your men stand? Are you with me or what?” Páez said, “Yes, we are with you. Nothing has changed.” “Okay, good. Let’s get back to it.” So reported troop strength numbers fluctuate a lot, depending on the source you read, but combined, Bolívar and Páez currently led somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 men. And though they would ultimately disagree about where this year’s campaign was headed, they once again agreed that attacking General Morillo was the obvious opening move. And at the moment, Morillo was headquartered at a spot called Las Queseras del Medio. And again, numbers are difficult to establish, and in total, Morillo commanded somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000 men, but how many were actually there with him is unclear to me. In fact, picking through the details of what happened next has been pretty tricky in general, because accounts differ and provide different significant details. But it’s a pretty big moment in the wars, so I’m pretty sure that this is how things unfolded. ",
            "On April 2, 1819, Bolívar granted Páez permission to launch an attack on Morillo’s forces. But the ever-daring Páez only rode off with 150 men – one, five, o. He broke his men up into small squadrons to ride around, kicking up dust to make sure it seemed like the whole republican army was on the move. Now, Morillo was probably tricked into thinking that more than just 150 men were on the way, but he was by now fully aware of Páez’s standard hit and run tactics, and so Morillo was at least prepared for that when it came. And in fact, he laid a pretty careful trap. When the dust clouds were reported, Morillo mobilized about a thousand cavalrymen and arrayed them at the far wings of his army with the infantry and heavy guns in the center. When Páez’s llaneros charged in for the hit, Morillo launched his own cavalry on a diagonal line to cut off the run. So this started out according to plan for both sides. Páez came charging in for the hit and then turned around for the run. But now an overwhelming cavalry force was threatening to close off their escape. So Páez ordered one of his best officers, a guy named Juan José Rondón, to wheel around with a small company and charge headlong back into the center of the royalist infantry. And this had the intended effect. The royalist cavalry wings took the bait and collapsed in on Rondón’s little band, while Páez and the rest of his llaneros were able to keep riding away. But just before he was fully enveloped, Rondón and his men broke off their attack, wheeled around again, and then burst through the last little sliver of daylight. With the royalist cavalry now ramming into each other and the infantry, everything in their lines devolved into a tangled mess of confusion. When Páez saw all the disarray, he gave the most famous order of his career. Now, the official sanitized version is that he yelled “¡Vuelvan caras!,” or “About face!,” but historians make it far more likely that he yelled “¡Vuelve a carajo!,” which has a few literal ways it can be translated, but my Spanish-speaking friends on Twitter think I can go with “Go back, goddamn it.” And yes, you can come find me on Twitter at @mikeduncan. It’s actually way easier to get a hold of me there than by email. ",
            "Anyway, after yelling “Go back, goddamn it!”, all 150 of his men wheeled around and charged headlong back into the disorganized mess of royalists. With confusion reigning and believing that they were well and truly under attack by the whole republican army, the royalists all panicked. The cavalry just rode off, leaving the infantry to fend for themselves and understandably spooked, the infantry then broke and fled in all directions, just trying to get out of this alive. When the dust finally cleared, upwards of 500 Spaniards lay dead, and all their heavy artillery pieces were just sitting around waiting to be picked up. Having beaten a force that was at a minimum ten times larger than his own, the Lion of the Apure lost two dead and six wounded. In the aftermath of the battle, General Morillo sent back a report stating that he had been attacked by at least 700 men, and it’s not clear whether he believed that or was exaggerating to cover his butt, as Generals throughout history have been wont to do. ",
            "The two sides then spent the rest of April and May 1819 waging an indecisive war of skirmishes. Bolívar desperately wanted to deliver one more decisive blow before moving on, but Morillo wasn’t having it, and he refused to be baited into a battle. This was frustrating because the rainy season was starting to set in, and Bolívar couldn’t afford to wait much longer to execute the plan that he had been keeping secret for months — a surprise invasion of New Granada. But the final piece of that secret plan finally fell into place at the end of May when he got a letter from Francisco de Paula Santander, and Bolívar knew it was time to move on. ",
            "So, backing up a little bit, after Bolívar and Páez and Santander had gone their separate ways in the summer of 1818, with Bolívar going back to Angostura and Páez staying in the Venezuelan Llanos, Santander had crossed back over into New Granada to recruit men, and most especially, gather intelligence on the state of affairs and whether New Granada could even be taken by an invasion. After nine months of work, Santander finally wrote back to Bolívar to say, yes, New Granada is ripe for the plucking. Come on over. And though Santander is not exactly an unbiased observer, I mean, he wants Bolívar to invade New Granada, he wasn’t wrong. Remember, General Morillo had brought most of his own army back into Venezuela, leaving behind a small core of peninsular soldiers to manage things with the help of some local militia. Santander was able to report that these forces were not exactly crack units. They were underpaid, under-supplied, and very low on morale. And then, just in general, the viceroy that Morillo had reinstalled in Bogotá believed that harsh repression was the most effective means to bring the country back into line. Morillo counseled ruling with a lighter hand, but the viceroy wanted no part of it, and Bogotá had become a repressive hub of summary executions, property confiscation, and just general maltreatment of the locals. Whether they were diehard patriots or not, the people of New Granada did not like the new viceregal regime. All of this Santander jubilantly reported to Bolívar. ",
            "So Bolívar now made his move. On May 23, 1819, he called his senior officers for a small council of war in the town of Setenta. There, using cattle skulls for chairs, Bolívar revealed his plan. They would march across the Llanos, up into the mountains of New Granada, surprise the royalists, and seize Bogotá. Now, this is Bolívar at his most recklessly daring. Remember, this is the beginning of the wintry rainy season, and already the Llanos were filling with water from rains that never ceased. The mountains would be more of the same, except everything would be freezing cold to boot. Now was the time to retire for the winter, not literally march into some of the steepest mountains in the world, but Bolívar believed that it could be done. And more importantly, if it were done, it would be a strategic masterstroke. ",
            "Now, his plan was inspired both by the recent example of José de San Martín, who had just liberated Chile with his own surprise invasion through the Andes, and also by the most famous general in history. Because it goes without saying that Bolívar was well-versed in the life and career of Hannibal. And if you guys remember from back in the History of Rome, Hannibal always preferred difficult terrain to the fortunes of a battle not of his choosing. His own march through the Alps in terrible weather is legendary. But even more impressive was that time he marched three days through a supposedly impenetrable swamp to split the legions and surprise the Romans at their rear. That was when he lost his eye. ",
            "Taking an army into the mountains now was brilliant because it was insane. General Morillo suspected Bolívar’s ultimate intention was to invade New Granada, but there was plenty of time to prepare for that because it’s not like they were going to leave tomorrow. And as for the royalist forces in New Granada, well, it quite rightly did not even occur to them that an invasion might be coming from Venezuela, which was Bolívar’s point. His officers agreed that it was crazy. But doable. ",
            "The only dissenter to all this was Páez, which drove Bolívar crazy because Páez had actually been the first man Bolívar had confided his plans to. And he seemed at the time to have been in full agreement. But now that it was actually before him, the Centaur of the Plains did not want to leave the plains, and you can’t really blame him. Half-naked cowboys who ride around in grasslands are not exactly well-suited for frozen, steep, mountainous terrain. But though furious at the perceived betrayal, Bolívar once again recognized that he could not risk losing a staring contest to Páez. So Bolívar compromised. He ordered Páez to take up a position at Cúcuta, which was still on the other side of the border in New Granada and still off the Llanos. But rather than participating in the full invasion, Páez would watch the rear and make sure that Morillo did not follow. To this, Páez agreed, and he also further agreed to let some of his men go with Bolívar, including the hero of Las Queseras del Medio, Juan José Rondón. But even with this compromise in place, Páez still continued to take Bolívar’s orders under mere advisement. And after Bolívar rode away, Páez turned around and headed east. He never would go to Cúcuta. ",
            "On May 26, 1819, Bolívar set out with 2,100 men divided into four infantry battalions and three cavalry squadrons. Also in the mix were various noncombatant auxiliaries, including families of some of the men, especially from among the 300 or so British legionaries who, as I said, had signed up for service in South America as much to try to start a new life there as to go on some grand military adventure. And one of the women present was, I kid you not, nine months pregnant. I don’t know her name, but we’ll get to her in a second. Now, no one was told what the ultimate destination was going to be because Bolívar quite rightly feared mass desertion. ",
            "Now, before they could even begin the grueling march up into the mountains, they had to get to the mountains. So Bolívar pointed them in the direction of Tame on the other side of the border in New Granada, where Santander was waiting with his own small army. But Tame was over 250 miles away, and by now the rains were nonstop and torrential. As I mentioned a few times, during the dry season, the Llanos is bone dry, but during the rainy season, everything floods. So this is not a time to go out marching. But the only way to get from here to there was to march from here to there. In the best of conditions, this meant slogging through thick mud that enveloped their feet and their carts and their horses and their animals. Worse conditions meant wading through standing water up to their knees and then up to their waists. The worst conditions meant literally swimming alongside improvised leather boats that held their gear. And always it rained and always there were bugs. Animals died, supplies, guns, and carts were abandoned if they became immovable, and even if this all hadn’t ended with a march through the mountains, this march through the wintry Llanos rain would have been impressive all on its own. Just before the army crossed the border into New Granada, Bolívar finally revealed to his men what this was all about, that this was, in fact, the beginning of the invasion of New Granada. And by this point, the only way out was forward. ",
            "Finally, in the last week of June, the beleaguered army hit dry ground as the grasslands gave way to the foothills at the base of the mountains, and they successfully linked with Santander’s forces at Tame. The men were given a week to recuperate from their long march through the flooded plains. But on July 1, 1819, it was back to it. And now the going was going to get really tough. ",
            "The small army traveled west as the crow flies, but mostly they went up, up, up, up. The rains never stopped, except now. Instead of mud and floodwater, it was all slick rocks and iced-over paths that ran along narrow ravines. And it’s not like these guys had gone to REI to get outfitted for the ascent. They were poor peasant soldiers. These guys were marching barefoot. They marched in tattered rags that could only charitably be called a uniform. As they struggled up the mountain, the strong started to carry the weak, and Bolívar personally carried men broken from whatever combination of hunger and fatigue, sickness or injury had taken them down. Many just didn’t make it. They dropped dead, and everyone else just kept walking up, up, up, because you can’t go back now. They would hit torrential creeks, raging from winter rain, and have to cross in a single-file line, with each person holding the hand of the man in front of them and behind them, forming a human chain until they all reached the other side. They would reach chasms that could only be crossed by stringing a rope between the trees and fixing improvised leather hammocks to take men and women across one by one. And eventually, they crested 13,000 feet as they wound their way around the tallest peaks, hypothermia set in. And even if you wanted to stop, you couldn’t because you would just freeze to death. ",
            "On July 3, on the third day of the climb, that pregnant woman I mentioned, she gave birth. Now, as the father of two small children, I’ve just been through all of this, and frankly, I consider the woman’s presence on the march to be insane already. But then, on top of that insanity, right now, in the middle of all this, she gives birth. The next day, Bolívar spotted her with a newborn strapped to her chest under a blanket as she just kept walking. Now, I have no idea what happened to her because after this, she just disappears from the record, but I have to say, of everything I’ve talked about over the whole course of the show, all of it, everyone, this unnamed woman giving birth in the middle of this deadly, treacherous hike, it might be the single most badass moment I’ve ever heard of. I mean, my god, this isn’t something I’m making up. This actually happened. ",
            "On July 6, after six days of marching, the bedraggled little army finally hit a safe oasis, the town of Soacha, about 150 miles northeast of Bogotá. The residents there had been alerted that this liberating army was doing this insane thing and rushed out to their aid. They brought food and blankets and water and gave them fire, literally the essentials of life, to save these men and women who had done this crazy, reckless, brave thing. But there was one upside to all this. The royalist forces had no idea that they were there. They had no garrisons even remotely close, and no prearranged plan for how to deal with an invasion right now in all this crappy weather in July 1819. Bolívar’s men were all half-dead. But to a certain degree, they had the enemy right where they wanted them. ",
            "Now, as he himself struggled up the mountains, Francisco de Paula Santander was able to observe Bolívar’s relentless energy, his courage, and genuine compassion for the men who were following him. Now, as with Páez, Bolívar and Santander had a complicated relationship and, for example, Santander had never gotten over that time Bolívar threatened to shoot him right at the beginning of the Admirable campaign six years earlier. But here Santander was blown away by Bolívar’s resolve, his determination, and his genuine spirit of patriotic unity. I mean, all that talk of everyone being in this together was one thing when Bolívar was trying to convince New Granadans to come help him liberate his home country of Venezuela, but now Bolívar was showing the same relentless resolve the other way. He was leading Venezuelans to liberate New Granada, and Bolívar then wasted no time making sure that their shared sacrifice was not all in vain. He immediately began planning the next stage of the campaign, and Santander later said, ",
            "“Here is where this man distinguishes himself above the rest, exhibiting extraordinary resolve and energy. In three days, he remounts and arms the cavalry, musters ammunition, reassembles the army, then sends out patrols, energizes the citizens, and plans an all-out attack.” ",
            "Now, even though Santander and Bolívar would spend as much time in conflict with each other as in partnership, at this moment Santander came to realize that whatever else he thought about Bolívar, Bolívar’s shtick was not empty vanity; he was the real deal. ",
            "By now, word was spreading that this republican army had appeared out of nowhere, and the ranking Spanish General, a guy named José María Barreiro, quickly mustered what forces he could, ultimately about 4,000 men, to put them between Bolívar’s army and Bogotá. ",
            "Now, after the dead were subtracted and new recruits added, Bolívar was now leading an army of about 2,600 men, and near the end of July, they were on the move towards Bogotá. On July 25, they finally ran into the royalists at Pantano de Vargas, literally the Vargas Swamp, a region of swampy marshes rimmed by low hills, and General Barreiro was able to occupy those hills with his royalist forces, which gave him two essential advantages: he both outnumbered Bolívar and held the high ground, and this is usually game, set, match. But Bolívar, of course, decided to launch a full frontal assault right into the teeth of this. When things, quite predictably, started going badly for the republicans, their left flank was being turned to disarray, the British legionary stepped into the breach and held back any finishing blow, which gave just enough time for Juan José Rondón, the hero of Las Queseras del Medio, to lead the cavalry on a furious charge up into the high ground wielding nothing but spears and machetes. They crashed into the shocked royalist line just as heavy rain started to fall. The royalist soldiers had been preparing for a long winter of sitting around doing nothing, not, you know, standing here in the rain being attacked by machete-wielding crazy people from Venezuela. They completely caved, broke, and fled. Santander later reported that the Battle of Pantano de Vargas had been won by the calm of the British and the intensity of the llaneros. ",
            "In the aftermath of his defeat at the Vargas Swamp, though, the royalist General Barreiro made a critical decision. He decided to lie his head off to the viceroy about the battle. He sent a dispatch assuring the viceroy that the republicans had been beaten soundly and that everything was well in hand. Now, what I’m guessing here is that Barreiro did this for two reasons. First, he did not want to provoke a panic in Bogotá that might trigger a patriotic insurrection. And second, he wanted to buy himself some time to regroup, catch Bolívar, and deliver the crushing blow he now already claimed had been delivered. But that’s not how things are going to go. Instead, this lie would set the stage for the decisive battle of the campaign, the battle that to this very day marks the beginning of true independence for Colombia: the Battle of Boyaca. ",
            "On August 7, 1819, the two sides were maneuvering around Tunja, once the capital of the now-defunct Union of New Granada. Bolívar’s forces still numbered about 2,600, Barreiro’s about 2,800. But as the royalists moved around Tunja, trying to get onto the main road back to Bogotá, they split in two, with an advanced guard approaching a key bridge over the Boyaca River and a rear guard about a mile behind them. Now, Bolívar had posted a small cavalry unit near the bridge to keep an eye on things. And when this advanced guard approached and saw that little unit, they thought it was the only small unit in the area. But Bolívar’s entire army was just behind a hill, out of sight. So these two little cavalry units skirmished against each other. But when the republican forces fell back, they fell back not out of sight, but into the waiting embrace of a much larger force led by Santander. The royalist vanguard realized they had made a mistake, that a much larger army was right around the corner. But then they made another mistake. Rather than racing back to reunite with the rear of the army, they raced forward to capture the Boyaca Bridge. Now, this seemed like a good idea at the time, hold the critical bridge, but it split the royalist army in two, and the force led by Santander was hot on their heels. And so, yes, they took the bridge and got to the other side, but now they were pinned down there and cut off from their comrades. ",
            "Meanwhile, the rest of Bolívar’s army came pouring out around the hill. They located the royalist rear guard strung out along the road and hit them from all sides. Bolívar ordered the British legionaries to attack the front of the royalists. Rondón and the llaneros rode around the back and hit them from the rear. And then Bolívar ordered everyone else on a bayonet charge right into their center. General Barreiro’s forces were hit from three sides simultaneously by a surprise attack. All told, the Battle of Boyaca lasted no more than 2 hours, and it was a complete republican victory. General Barreiro himself was cornered and captured, as were 1,600 of his men. Another 500 lay dead, and the rest just scattered. There was now quite literally no royalist army within 500 miles of Bogotá. The question now was not whether the republicans would take the capital, but whether they would capture the viceroy in the process. ",
            "They nearly did capture the viceroy, but about 50 of the men who had been pinned down by Santander at the bridge managed to get away. They raced for Bogotá to raise the alarm. Now, the city had no idea anything was even remotely amiss. The viceroy was, in fact, sitting around having dinner when a messenger burst in and told him the enemy was victorious and nothing was standing between them and Bogotá. After getting over his shock, the viceroy had no time to do anything but just run. His attendants dressed him up like a peasant, and he snuck out of town. Bolívar would later send agents out looking for him, but the viceroy was never located, and he never stopped running either. He wound up making it all the way to Cartagena, and then he immediately got on a ship and sailed back to Spain, never to return. ",
            "Meanwhile, Bolívar was on a race of his own. With the smoke at Boyaca barely cleared, he was off like a shot at full gallop to close the 100 miles or so to Bogotá. And when he arrived in the city, he found himself greeted by bewildered citizens. I mean, less than 12 hours ago, they had been under the impression that whatever small invading force that had come up through the mountains had been beaten, and that was if they knew anything about any of this at all. And instead, what? General Bolívar is here, and he’s won? The viceroy is gone? And then Bolívar discovered just how close he had come to capturing the viceroy. There were literally still bags of money on his desk just left behind in the rush. The treasury was full. The munitions depot were stocked. This was a complete victory on all fronts. ",
            "But Bolívar had been in the dark himself about a lot of what had gone on in New Granada. And when he greeted men that he had known from the last time he had passed through Bogotá in 1815, he asked around for the others. “Where’s President Camilo Torres, the man who supported me in my darkest hours?” He was dead. His head had been chopped off and posted on a spike. Or what about this guy? What about that guy? They had all been killed in the aftermath of Morillo’s reconquest. It was a sobering back end to an otherwise jubilant moment. ",
            "Now, since we know how this all turns out, we know that the Battle of Boyaca marks the beginning of Colombian independence, real, permanent independence. There was no guarantee at the time that it would, nor any way that anyone could have known that it would. But it did. Bolívar’s dramatic push into New Granada had fundamentally altered the political and geographic axis of the war. The republicans were no longer confined to a few interior bases, hiding out in Angostura, playing congress. They now controlled a huge stretch of territory reaching from the Orinoco River to Bogotá, and in no time, they would bring all of the interior of New Granada under Republican jurisdiction. It was now the royalists who were confined, restricted to a few ports along the coast, short of men, and now knocked thoroughly back on their heels. ",
            "When General Morillo was briefed about what had happened, he wrote a report to the Ministry of War back in Spain and said, ",
            "“The rebellious Bolívar has occupied the capital of Bogotá, and the deadly outcome of this battle gives him dominion over the enormous resources of a highly populated, abundantly rich nation, from which he will take whatever he needs to prolong the war. This unfortunate loss delivers into rebel hands, apart from the kingdom of New Granada, many ports in the south, where he will now deploy his pirates, the interior of the continent, all the way to Peru, is at the mercy of whoever rules in Bogotá. In just one day, Bolívar has undone all that we have accomplished in five years of this campaign, and in one single battle, he has reconquered all the territory that soldiers of the King have won in the course of so many past conflagrations.” ",
            "Bolívar then set up shop in the great capital of Bogotá and began putting together the bare bones of a new government to rule New Granada. But it was never his destiny to be a man of laws. And he was itching to get back on his horse to ride triumphantly through liberated New Granada, spreading the good news that they were all free. And most especially, to return to Venezuela to trumpet the success of the invasion. And then return to Angostura to make preparations for the true union of Venezuela and New Granada. To no longer hide on the Orinoco river, but to meet out in the open and in full dignity. So, at the end of September 1819, he appointed Santander, the man who was destined to be the man of laws, vice president of New Granada, and left him the difficult task of organizing a restored republic. And this was truly a job for Santander, always a mediocre soldier at best, who did not fit in easily with the rough men who had been so easily won over by Bolívar. Santander was completely in his element, seated behind a desk, drawing up edicts and reforms and tax codes and an entire political apparatus. And that is where Santander would stay, becoming the founder of modern Colombia, as Bolívar himself left the capital in September 1819."

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "The Battle of Boyaca was, for once, an indisputable and permanent triumph for Simón Bolívar. He had been a professional revolutionary for nearly a decade now, and he had spent most of it trapped in a revolving door. He was exiled, and then returned, and then exiled and returned again. He won battles, but then suffered equivalent reverses. He suffered equivalent reverses, but then somehow bounced back. He was constantly on the move, but he never seemed to get anywhere. Well, now he had finally gotten somewhere. New Granada was cleared of any peninsular royalist army. The republicans had seized Bogotá, and they would not be giving it back. The nation that would become modern Colombia was now free and independent and would remain so. The only part of the colony still under Spanish control was now Cartagena. And though Cartagena was a city that could be defended militarily by six guys in a slingshot, it could be reduced by prolonged siege. And in short order, it would be under a prolonged siege. ",
            "But this was no time to sit back and bask in the glow of victory, to get lazy or complacent. Quite the opposite. The liberation of New Granada only fueled Bolívar’s momentum. He remained in Bogotá from the first week of August to the last week of September 1819. But as we ended last week’s episode, Bolívar put the government in the hands of Santander and then himself rode off on a slow-moving tour northeast through the newly liberated cities of New Granada on his way back to Venezuela. In every city he passed, there were celebrations and balls and parties and dancing. Bolívar’s entourage became a traveling celebration as the people rejoiced in their liberation. And though Bolívar celebrated, and the whole thing must have been something of a dream, reality did not waste much time crashing back down on his head. ",
            "For one thing, even though Bolívar was constantly surrounded by secretaries and soldiers and civilian well-wishers, at this moment of his greatest triumph, he was personally in a very lonely place. It had now been fully three years since he had laid eyes on his longtime mistress, Pepita Machado. He did not know where she was or whether or not he would see her again. Now, if you recall from back in Episode 5.14, Pepita had been with him through the disaster at Ocumare in the summer of 1816, but after redepositing her on the island of St. Thomas, they had just never linked back up. In the intervening years, Bolívar had been re-exiled to Haiti in 1816, then returned to Venezuela and gone off and captured Angostura in 1817, then led that failed campaign to capture Caracas in 1818, and then marched across the Llanos and up into the mountains of New Granada in 1819. Pepita had been present for none of this. Now, mostly, this was because in the chaos of war, they had lost touch with each other. I mean, it’s the early 1800s, keeping in contact with somebody over long distances is tricky in the best of times, but in all of this mess, forget it. ",
            "So after returning to Angostura in the summer of 1818, Bolívar finally said enough is enough, and he sent a nephew to personally track Pepita down. Now, this was a search that took months, but ultimately the happy news that Pepita had been finally located on the island still of St. Thomas and would soon be on her way. But it was still a while before Bolívar got confirmation that she had actually boarded a ship. And even then, days continued to pass without any sign of her. ",
            "In the meantime, Bolívar kept busy arranging the Congress of Angostura and then preparing for his still-secret plan to invade New Granada, a plan that included a place for Pepita by his side, but she just kept not showing up. By the time he had to march into New Granada in May 1819, he had to ride without her. And so, he was now forced to celebrate his greatest triumph alone. ",
            "Adding to his depressed spirits, after leaving Bogotá, Bolívar proceeded to get hit by a continuous string of bad news. I don’t know exactly the order that all of this came in, but I would guess that the first thing he heard was that Santander had gone and done something really dumb. ",
            "In the aftermath of the Battle of Boyaca, most of the senior royalist commanders had been captured alive, including the Commander in Chief, General José María Barreiro. With the war to the death ancient history, Bolívar treated his prisoners with all due courtesy, and he hoped to eventually exchange them for republican prisoners. But almost as soon as Bolívar departed Bogotá, Santander decided he could not risk letting these officers live. On October 11, Santander ordered General Barreiro and 38 others removed from confinement and marched into the center of town. They were given no explanation for the sudden rousting and not even the courtesy of a perfunctory tribunal. It was, in fact, only when Santander ordered Barreiro to kneel that the royalist General finally understood what was going on. With no further ceremony, Santander ordered the kneeling general shot in the back. Then the other 38 men were lined up against a wall and executed. It was a shocking scene for the residents of the city. Though they were happy the viceroy was gone, General Barreiro himself had never been particularly disliked. I mean, many people actually liked him quite a bit. And then, to add insult to injury, Santander then led a parade to celebrate and capped it all off with a splendid ball. The sudden cruelty of Santander’s new regime came as an unwelcome surprise to the residents of Bogotá. When Bolívar was told about all this, he wrote a tense letter back to Santander saying, “Okay, I understand that you were afraid that they might have gotten up to something, but really, this is not how I wanted things handled, and it will make our lives difficult. But okay, I forgive you for doing what you thought was best.” Clearly, though, this was through gritted teeth. Though he could not risk Santander going completely rogue, so Bolívar kept the chastisement to a minimum. ",
            "Shortly thereafter, Bolívar was told that another General he couldn’t risk alienating had also ignored his orders. Because it turned out that José Antonio Páez had never gone to Cúcuta as he had been ordered. That instead of guarding the rear while Bolívar pushed up into the mountains, Páez had ridden hundreds of miles east to winter in the small town of Achaguas.",
            "So, as Bolívar crossed back into Venezuela, he recognized that he was going to have to once again walk a fine line between reprimanding Páez and alienating him. Now, in general, I did give you an order, and you did say you would do it. I know you’re not a military man by training, but that does have to mean something. But he couldn’t go too far and drive Páez away from the cause, because without Páez, there was no free Venezuela. And it really was that simple. ",
            "Then, once he crossed the border into Venezuela, Bolívar got hit with two pieces of personally tragic news. The first was that one of his favorite officers and a guy Bolívar had been grooming for a prominent position in the hierarchy of the new Republic had suddenly gotten sick and just died. And as if that wasn’t depressing enough, the really terrible news hit. The reason Pepita Machado had never appeared in Angostura was that she, too, was dead. There is no confirmed version of what actually happened to her. Some say she never left St. Thomas. Others say that she sailed away but died en route. Others said she made it to the mainland but died before reaching Angostura. And others say that she passed through Angostura, made it up the Orinoco River, and out onto the Llanos before finally succumbing to a fatal illness. The common link does seem to be that that fatal illness was tuberculosis, but even that is built on unsubstantiated rumors. Frankly, nobody knows what really happened to Pepita Machado. The news hit Bolívar like a ton of bricks, but he was good at compartmentalization and all about that old-style Roman stoicism in the face of adversity. But just a few months after riding triumphantly into Bogotá after the Battle of Boyaca, he had to have just been emotionally deflated. ",
            "And then came even more bad news. News that turned his slow procession into a rapid march. It had been just about nine months since Bolívar had departed Angostura, and he had left behind what he thought was a functional government in what he thought were the capable hands of Vice President Francisco Antonio Zea. The armies of the eastern caudillos were supposedly sitting there just awaiting further instructions, but now he received dispatches that all was not well back east. That Santiago Mariño had refused an order from the vice president to join his forces with Bermúdez. And further, that another key General, a guy whose name I have not specifically mentioned yet, but it’s Juan Bautista Arismendi, had been insubordinate enough that Bermúdez had tossed him in jail. And though Bolívar did not know it at the time, the situation was further being rocked by a strong rumor that Bolívar himself had been killed in New Granada. Bolívar quickened his return home, but events would move faster than he could. ",
            "Indeed, by the time Bolívar found out that things were amiss back east, they had likely already gotten even more amiss. Bolívar had studiously avoided major confrontations with insubordinate commanders over the years, Manuel Piar being the one notable exception. But Vice President Zea had tried to test the legitimate authority of the civilian government by sacking General Santiago Mariño for his refusal to follow orders. But Mariño had quite a bit more juice, both politically and, of course, militarily, than Vice President Zea did. So after getting fired, Mariño began conspiring with the aforementioned General Arismendi, and that conspiring took real shape when the rumors came round that Simón Bolívar was dead. Mariño and Arismendi decided to overthrow Zea, which turned out to be not too hard at all. All they had to do was roll into Angostura and have a very frank chat with the members of Congress about the future of the Republic. “If Bolívar is dead, we cannot trust ourselves to this old man who controls no armies, has fought no battles, and spilled no blood.” And the members of Congress agreed. They voted to depose Zea from office. Arismendi was elected the new Vice President, and Mariño went from being fired to Commander in Chief of all the eastern armies. ",
            "After this simple little coup, Mariño returned to his base up along the north coast to reorganize the army to his own specifications, while Arismendi remained in Angostura to cement the new order of things. Then, in early December 1819, Arismendi rode out on a military inspection tour of his own. So he was not around when a ghost rode into Angostura in the middle of the night. ",
            "At 3:00 in the morning, on December the 11, 1819, the Liberator, Simón Bolívar returned, not dead, very much alive. The people of the city were thrilled. And even though it was the middle of the night, word got out that the Liberator was coming back, and they flocked to greet him. ",
            "Exhausted from his journey, though, which had taken him from Bogotá to Angostura in just 64 days, Bolívar spent the next two days holed up in his house recuperating and taking interviews with men and women who could fill him in on what had happened in his absence. And then he visited the deposed Zea to get his version of events. Arismendi, meanwhile, was alerted that Bolívar had returned and I have to imagine he went a little bit white when he got the news. But he mounted his horse and rode straight for Angostura to try to head off what may turn out to be dire consequences. But when Arismendi arrived, Bolívar did not greet him with fireballs of wrath, but instead welcomed him with open arms and told him, “You’ve done a good job. It sounded like things got very confused and maybe even a little dangerous, and you did what you thought best to preserve the Republic. Isn’t that right? Isn’t it?” And Arismendi was like, “Yeah, that’s absolutely right.” And Bolívar said, “Well, now that that’s all cleared up and everything’s fine, you’ll be happy to return the vice presidency to Zea, right?” And Arismendi recognized the face-saving out Bolívar was handing him on a silver platter. So Arismendi announced that, “Yes, of course, immediately I will resign now that the Liberator is home.” And he did. ",
            "Santiago Mariño, meanwhile, continued to face no consequences for his own repeated insubordinations. Although when Bolívar goes out for his next major campaign, he will make sure Mariño joins his staff and will not let him out of his sight. ",
            "With all that settled, Bolívar convened the Congress of Angostura on December 14 to deliver a formal report. New Granada has been liberated, Bogotá is in republican hands, and the time has come to make good on the grandiose proclamations we made when the Congress first convened back in February. We must unite and form Gran Colombia for real. On December 17, the Congress agreed and voted that the union would go into full effect. Bolívar was given the title Liberator President and Zea was confirmed as Vice President of the whole republic. But then they also created two junior vice presidencies. Santander was elected Vice President of the Department of New Granada, and a guy named Juan Germán Roscio, who is a minor figure in the grand scheme of things but for the record, was one of the signatories to the original declaration of Venezuelan independence back in 1811, he was elected Vice President of the Department of Venezuela. Then the Congress voted to convene a new constitutional convention in Cúcuta on January 1, 1821, to work out the details of a joint government, now that both New Granada and Venezuela would be able to fully participate. ",
            "The government, hopefully now back on the right track, Bolívar turned back to his last military problem: General Pablo Morillo and the 7,000 or so royalist soldiers who still occupied the critical northwestern coast of Venezuela. And though Morillo was hemmed in, Bolívar had learned back in the summer of 1818 that it was not wise to just go launching a full frontal attack, especially because retaining soldiers in the Republican army was becoming nearly impossible. The wars of independence had been going on for nearly a decade now, and the Grim Reaper had already harvested half a generation’s worth of young men, and it was hard to convince the rest to stay in the army, especially when they were never paid or fed what they had been promised they would be paid and fed. It seemed like for every man recruited into the army, two more would slip out the back of the tent. Not that there were tents. That’s just a metaphor. ",
            "So supplying and paying the army became Bolívar’s overriding concern, and Bolívar was eventually furious with Zea, for example, when he discovered that rather than directing cattle meat from the Llanos to the army, Zea had been selling it to merchants from the United States. And then, and I’m not making this up, after facing a shortage of meat in Venezuela, buying meat from the United States and losing money on the deal. It was pretty amateur hour stuff, to be honest, and Bolívar started to suspect that maybe Zea was not actually the man for the job. ",
            "Ever on the move, though, Bolívar departed Angostura again almost as soon as he had arrived back out to inspect what troops he had and then really to make his way all the way back to New Granada to recruit men to serve in what he hoped would be the final campaign to liberate Venezuela. After all, we liberated you. It’s time for you to return the favor. So he rode and rode, retracing the journey he had just made because they don’t call him Iron Ass for nothing. He was soon riding back up into the mountains and back through the cities of New Granada on his way to Bogotá to check in with Santander. But the recruitment effort was disappointing, as were reports from Santander that the tax receipts were not as robust as they needed to be. When Bolívar reached Bogotá, he and Santander conferred over what to do. Bolívar told him, first of all, to just squeeze the provinces for money. Voluntary patriotic contributions were not going to get the job done. ",
            "But Bolívar also raised a subject that would help drive a wedge between the two men. After being converted to the cause of emancipation by Alexandre Pétion, Bolívar had not wavered in his commitment to freeing the slaves, and he told Santander that when the Constitutional Convention met in Cúcuta, that emancipation must be written into the fabric of the Republic of Colombia. And beyond the moral dimension, there was a very simple military dimension, that the newly freed black citizens must be given the opportunity to show their loyalty and fight in the army. It simply isn’t fair that they haven’t been given the chance to fight for their own freedom. But Santander balked and would continue to balk at emancipation. He did not think it wise to upend the few money making plantations left in the country, and he agreed only that if emancipation came, that it would have to be done slowly and carefully. The fate of the slaves would remain a point of contention between the two for the remainder of their revolutionary partnership. ",
            "After just three weeks in Bogotá, Bolívar moved out of the capital again and set up a base of operations in Cúcuta, which was the most centrally located city in republican hands, and from there, he could keep his eye on Bogotá, the Magdalena River, the ongoing siege of Cartagena, the Venezuelan Llanos, and hopefully be ready to strike at Morillo in Caracas if the Republican army could get its act together. ",
            "So through the whole first half of 1820, a tense stalemate settled in everywhere. Morillo obviously had no intention of making any offensive moves until he could get some reinforcements, which he had been told for quite a while now, were on their way but never seemed to be on their way. Meanwhile, Bolívar for once did not risk losing everything by launching an offensive campaign before his army was really ready. Both commanders made limited moves, but mostly just to mask their respective weaknesses from each other. ",
            "But in June of 1820, word of a major, major, major development back in Spain leaked that would change everything. It was information that was by now months old, but, you know, that’s how it goes with cross Atlantic communications, especially cross Atlantic communications that are supposed to remain top secret. So to grasp the magnitude of this development, we have to hop back over to Spain for the first time in quite a while. ",
            "Now when last we checked in, it was back in Episode 5.12 – “The Desired One”, when we covered the return of King Ferdinand VII, aka the Desired one, to the Spanish throne. If you will recall, Ferdinand’s return spelled the end for the regency government that had ruled in his absence, and through the entirety of the Peninsular War, and the liberal Constitution of 1812 that they had ratified. But though the Spanish population in general wanted to reject the very French sounding ideas lodged in the Constitution of 1812, I don’t think anybody really wanted it to go back to how it had been before the abdications of Bayonne. There had to be some reforms, and Ferdinand was encouraged by many petitioners to call the original version of the Cortes, the medieval version, with the clergy and nobility and commons coming together to work out an understanding of how the restored monarchy was going to work going forward. And Ferdinand said, “Yeah, sure, that sounds great. Okay, I’ll let you know.” And then nothing. He never called the Cortes and he and a small group of loyal ministers went about trying to bring back the absolutist Ancien Régime in its entirety. And it did not take long for the desired one to not be very desirable at all. ",
            "So, there’s no need to get into the thickets of the high-handed incompetence of Ferdinand’s government as it affected Spain itself. What we need to focus on is their American policy. And when it came to the rebellious colonies, the regime’s policy was full pacification and the reestablishment of the old order, to turn the clock back to 1807 and pretend like nothing had ever happened. That had been the basic set of instructions the King had given General Morillo when the great Armada had set sail for Venezuela in February 1815. And for a long while, the reports coming back across the Atlantic confirmed the viability of this strategy of uncompromising reconquest. Morillo made a clean sweep through Venezuela and New Granada, and after capturing Bogotá, was preparing to move on Peru. But then the news took a sharp downward turn. Now, Morillo’s report said, “Venezuela has re-revolted, so instead of going to Peru, I’m going to have to go back to Venezuela.” And these new reports were always accompanied by Morillo’s request to be relieved of duty. And then news came in that a rebel army, led by the defector José de San Martín, had crossed the Andes, captured Chile, and now threatened Peru. So instead of a grand royalist army parading into Lima to complete the reconquest, it now appeared that the rebel scum were poised to attack the most lucrative colony in the whole empire. So Ferdinand’s ministers made plans to send reinforcements to Morillo in Venezuela, but even more importantly, to send a second Armada to the Río de la Plata to follow in the footsteps of San Martín and undo everything he had done. ",
            "But even as this new invasion was being planned, there seemed to be a clear change of direction coming out of the ministry by the beginning of 1818. One guy in particular who had been put in charge of all this, a senior minister named José Pizarro, started pointing out that they might be spitting into a hurricane here, that at a minimum, negotiating with the Americans was probably going to be more effective than reconquest. Pizarro said, “Look, you can save it all by compromising. You can dig in your heels and maybe save some of it, like Peru. But most likely, continuing down this uncompromising path is going to lose us everything.” ",
            "So in June 1818, Pizarro produced a massive pile of recommendations, an all-encompassing plan to keep the Americas in the Spanish orbit by conceding the end of Spanish absolutism. Pizarro recommended that the Spanish Americas be open not just to foreign trade, but also foreign settlement to rebuild the population and revitalize the American economy. He recommended increased participation of the criollos in their own government, an end to the trade monopolies, the works —everything, basically, that the Americans had been asking for. But the King did not want to hear it. After mulling it over with his closer advisors, Pizarro and anyone associated with him were dismissed in September 1818 and told to vacate the capital immediately. The King then got back to the business of uncompromising reconquest. ",
            "In the end, that uncompromising reconquest did not die in the Americas, but right there in Spain. To begin with, the Spanish Navy was hardly a navy at all. All the good ships had gone off with Morillo, with the first Armada, and not much had been built up in the meantime. So the King had personally authorized the purchase from Russia of a small fleet of ships. But when these ships arrived, they turned out to be lemons —scraps from the junk heap that were barely seaworthy. Basically, Russia ripped him off and there was nothing he could do about it. ",
            "But still, the King persisted, and over the course of 1819, men were transferred to Cádiz to muster for the expedition, and ultimately, they would number 14,000 men. But when these men arrived, they just sat there, and despite being something like 400 million pesos that had been spent so far on the expedition since it had first been dreamed up back in 1816, were as ill-fed, ill-supplied, and ill-paid as any of the troops in the Americas, rebel or royalists. The soldiers were reduced to begging food and supplies from the Cádiz merchants. And then, to top it all off, a little epidemic of plague swept through town, decimating the ranks of soldiers and civilians alike. ",
            "Now, as is often the case, the men had not been told why they were all being reassigned to Cádiz. They did not know what this was all about, certainly not that they were going to be sent to the Americas. But when the final preparations were being made in September 1819, the final destination leaked out, and the soldiers were dismayed and furious. They had heard plenty about the bloody, disease-ridden chaos of the Americas. They knew from their brothers, who had gone over with Morillo, what they could expect. Nothing good — probably just a grim death. And on top of that, this fight is to what? Reconquer the Americas? That meant nothing to them personally. I mean, it was one thing to suffer and die, to expel the French from the peninsula, but to go across the Atlantic to put down some provincials who are probably on the right side of history anyway, forget it. ",
            "The men started talking amongst themselves, and they agreed that, no, we are not going to do it. They can’t make us. The leader of this brewing mutiny was a guy named Colonel Rafael del Riego, commander of one of the ten battalions that composed the expedition. Riego was, like everybody else, a veteran of the Peninsular War, but he was also a strong liberal, and he had always begrudged the King for nullifying the Constitution of 1812. The return of the Desired One, in Riego’s mind, had been an unmitigated disaster, and it had sent Spain right back under the yoke of ignorant, backward repression. Riego looked around and decided that he might be able to convince the 14,000 disgruntled soldiers in Cádiz to turn their backs on the planned invasion of the Río de la Plata and instead march on Madrid. ",
            "On January 1, 1820, Riego and his fellow conspirators staged a mutinous revolt. They seized the commander of the expedition and declared themselves defenders of the Constitution of 1812. They demanded the King acknowledge the constitutional monarchy. Now, at first, Ferdinand scoffed at these demands, and he tried to blow off the mutiny as just unhappy soldiers who would soon be sailing across the Atlantic anyway, so there’s no point in giving it all too much credence. Except that the mutiny in Cádiz set off a string of similar mutinies in garrisons across Spain, and the civilian population was ominously sympathetic. Basically, the Spaniards had been willing to give Ferdinand the benefit of the doubt in 1814. But having been given the benefit of the doubt, King Ferdinand had blown it. And they were all now ready to say, “Eh, maybe the constitutional monarchy of 1812 is actually worth another look.” So through January and into February 1820, the mutinous revolt spread out, and soon it was knocking on the King’s doorstep in Madrid. Ferdinand tried his best to keep his head lodged firmly in the sand. “Now, this is all going to blow over. I don’t have to give in. I’ll just hold out a few more days.” But by March, the noose had been tied, placed around the King’s neck, and was now tightening, even if the King didn’t quite realize it yet. Finally, on March 6, the King and his ministers decided they might be able to buy themselves some time by officially calling for the Cortes, which they had been avoiding for so long, but that only bought them a few days. On March 9, 1820, in the midst of popular agitation consuming Madrid, the King was forced to go out onto the balcony of the Royal Palace and announce to the crowd that, yes, I accept the Constitution of 1812. The six years of restored Bourbon absolutism was dead, and the dawning of a new liberal era was at hand. ",
            "Now, what this means for the wars of Spanish American independence is that the expedition that was supposed to invade the Río de la Plata never sailed. And instead of the next chapter beginning with a huge army arriving in Buenos Aires, the next chapter started with nothing at all. The Río de la Plata would never face reconquest. José de Martín never had to break off his approach to Peru and go back to rescue them. ",
            "Because this army never showed up, the royalists in America were just going to have to make do with what they had on hand, and that was never going to be enough to stave off independence. So it’s all pretty much just an inevitable run from here on out. Now, probably the Americas wind up breaking away anyway, even with the influx of 14,000 new soldiers, because they probably would have just staved off that inevitability. I mean, eventually, it was just not going to be worth the men and resources to try to hold an entire continent in bondage against its will. That had kind of been Juan Pizarro’s ultimate point. So probably the Spanish eventually decide that they’re going to stop sending armies across the Atlantic no matter what. But instead of that coming in the future, it’s coming right now, today.",
            "In Venezuela and still awaiting his allotment of reinforcements, General Morillo did not get word that all of this unrest in Cádiz really was a really real problem until May of 1820, when the stunning news came of the King’s capitulation and acceptance of the Constitution of 1812. Oh, also, by the way, you are not getting any reinforcements. And you can imagine just how deep Morillo must have sunk into his chair when he read all this. But the kicker was that his new orders were to spread the good news to the Americans that they were all now equal citizens in a liberal kingdom and they can lay down their arms and go back to being happy and productive subjects of the Spanish Crown. Morillo positively exploded at the stupid ignorance of this order. No one in Spain obviously had the first idea what is going on over here. These people are not going to accept that they are going to be happy subjects of the Crown again. Not now, not after all this. It was over, and Morillo knew it. ",
            "General Morillo sat on the information as long as he could, but by June, he was stuck because he couldn’t keep it under wraps forever. Just as he was about to announce what had happened back in Spain to Caracas, Bolívar’s spies intercepted a letter from the King to Morillo, spelling out everything. And as deeply as Morillo must have sunk into his chair when he heard the news, you can imagine how quickly Bolívar must have sprung out of his or whatever he happened to be sitting on, probably a cattle skull or something. All that was left in all of Gran Colombia, standing between Bolívar and independence, were 7,000 Spaniards clinging to the coast without hope of reinforcement. You beat those guys, just those guys, and it’s all over. It had to be. And once word got out, General Morillo didn’t really do anything to pretend otherwise. ",
            "On July 6, 1820, messengers arrived at Bolívar’s headquarters in Cúcuta bearing a request for a summit with Morillo to discuss a ceasefire. Now, it took months of negotiations to arrange this summit, as both sides were very cautious about the intentions of the other. But they finally agreed to meet in the city of Trujillo at the end of November. And on November 21, 1820, representatives from both sides met and formally agreed to a ceasefire that would last for six months. The royalists would recognize Bolívar as president of this thing called the Republic of Colombia, and the particulars of the cessation of hostilities and the terms of prisoner exchanges were all worked out. With the details finalized, it finally became time for the two commanders to meet face to face for the first time. ",
            "On November 27, 1820, at the tiny village of Santa Ana, the two Generals finally laid eyes on each other. Morillo arrived first, decked out in his best uniform and accompanied by 50 splendid cavalrymen. Then he saw Bolívar’s little party arrive, consisting of just 15 men. And Morillo was shocked when Bolívar was pointed out to him because Bolívar was riding a donkey and wearing the uniform of a common soldier. Not wanting to be outdone in chivalry, Morillo ordered most of his cavalry to depart. And then he dismounted to greet Bolívar. And there, on the side of the road, the two men embraced. Then both sides retired to a small house to share a celebratory lunch that involved multiple toasts to each other, as professional soldiers do, to the valor and heroics of each other. And in the midst of all this, and probably quite drunk, they all agreed to build a great pyramid on the spot in the road where the two generals had embraced to forever mark the peace. And they went out, they found a big rock and plopped it down to mark the spot where the foundation needed to be laid. The toasting and drinking then continued into the night until eventually, rather than go their separate ways, Morillo and Bolívar each strung up a hammock in the same room, and they slept that night side by side. In the morning, they awoke, they returned to the big rock that they had left on the side of the road, probably now quite hungover, and embraced again. Then each rode off in their separate directions, never to meet again. ",
            "If the world was a better place, that would have been the end of it. The fighting and the killing would have stopped there at Santa Ana. But unfortunately, the world is not a better place. And when we return to our story, it will sadly turn out that the armistice would not even last its prescribed six months. Talking their way to independence was never going to work. If the Americans wanted to be free, they were going to have to decide the issue on the battlefield. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "Now, when last we left, our intrepid Spanish American revolutionary Simón Bolívar had just signed a six-month armistice with the royalist General Pablo Morillo. And then they had gotten drunk and plopped a big rock down on the side of the road to mark the occasion. But though a monument does indeed sit at the spot in rural Venezuela where they met, the six-month armistice was not the end of the War of Venezuelan Independence. And in fact, the six-month armistice did not even last six months. It was going to take one more campaign to end the war and liberate Venezuela once and for all. ",
            "Now, in later years, Bolívar would come under fire for even agreeing to the ceasefire in the first place. The remaining Spanish army was not in good shape, so why let your foot off their throat? Now, it’s impossible to tell whether Bolívar really thought the armistice was going to last, but he did later defend himself by saying that he had a secret agenda the whole time, that above all, he wanted General Morillo to leave. Morillo was a good General, the best the Spanish had, and Bolívar wanted him gone. And rumors had likely filtered back across the lines that Morillo had been trying to resign his command for years now and was possibly just waiting for a good excuse to say, “Well, my work here is done. I’m going to go home.” ",
            "And if that really was what Bolívar had in mind, then his plan went perfectly. He and Morillo parted company on November 8, 1820. General Morillo then rode back to Caracas, made a few final arrangements. He transferred control of the army to second in command, a guy named General Miguel de la Torre. And on December 17, 1820, a mere three weeks after meeting Bolívar, Morillo boarded a ship and sailed back to Spain, never to return. ",
            "Now, beyond just clearing Morillo off the board, though, Bolívar’s further thinking may have been that time was on his side, that a break in the action helped the republicans and hurt the royalists. And if that was his thinking, then he was right about that too. Everybody knew that no more reinforcements were coming from Spain, that the liberal revolt against Ferdinand VII earlier in the year meant that the Spanish troops in Venezuela were on their own. And with so few troops, they were confined to their own territory with little chance of breaking out. And frankly, there wasn’t much territory left anyway. The armistice drew a line between republican-held territory and royalist-held territory across which neither side was to cross. The royalists got the coastline from Caracas west, including some territory around Lake Maracaibo in the far west. Bolívar’s Republic of Colombia got the rest. So as the royalist soldiers sat in their garrisons, they had nothing to do but sit and think about how they were underpaid and underfed and how they had been so far from home for so long. Remember, these are still the soldiers who had come over with Morillo back in 1815. Well, now Morillo has gone home, and look, we’re still stuck. And it cannot have been good for morale when they found out that the reason there had been a giant insurrectionary mutiny back in Spain was because their brothers in arms in Cádiz were not going to allow themselves to get sent to the Americas. Think of how that must have made the guys already in the Americas feel about being there. ",
            "And that’s not even counting the fact that that insurrectionary mutiny meant that reinforcements were never going to come. There were somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000 men left in Venezuela, but I can’t imagine a single one of them wanted to be there anymore. So Bolívar likely believed that with each passing day, they would get more demoralized and disheartened while his own troops would get better trained, drilled, and equipped. ",
            "So while the Spaniards sat and stewed, Bolívar did lend some further proof that he really was just buying time by continuing to focus on training, drilling, and equipping the republican forces just so that they would be ready if, or perhaps, when the armistice ended. ",
            "Then in January of 1821, Bolívar got further good news coming out of the south. As we will discuss in detail next week, the armies of José de San Martín had begun their march north and were putting the still loyal Viceroyalty of Peru under intense pressure. This had then triggered a local revolt in the city of Guayaquil, who rose up and declared independence from Spain. Now, we talked briefly about Guayaquil back in Episode 5.7 – “The First Cry of Liberty”. They were the port city under the jurisdiction of Quito who kept refusing to support Quito during the various insurrections that they had staged in the precursor revolts. Well, now things are in reverse. With San Martín poised to take Lima, Guayaquil threw off the Spanish yoke and dared the royalists still holding Quito to do a damn thing about it. ",
            "The revolting Guayaquil provided Bolívar an opportunity he did not want to miss. Remember, he envisioned the Republic of Colombia incorporating all the old territories of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, and that included Quito and the areas under its jurisdiction, which is today the future nation of Ecuador. The claim to Quito had always been restricted to empty proclamations, though, the revolt in Guayaquil meant that the time to begin incorporating the region was possibly at hand. And even more important than jumping before the royalists were able to nip the revolt in the bud was jumping before San Martín took Peru because Bolívar was certainly not above wanting to state Colombian claims to the Quito region before any other republican faction in South America got there. ",
            "So in January of 1821, he peeled off a thousand troops and ordered them to go reinforce Guayaquil to defend it from royalist recapture and prepare for what Bolívar hoped would be a two-pronged assault on Quito once Venezuela was well and truly secured. And the man he put in charge of the operation was a man whose name I’d been sprinkling into the story but who is now on his way finally to the center of the stage, Antonio José de Sucre. ",
            "Now, around the same time, the new constitutional convention that had been scheduled after the great victory at Boyaca and the liberation of New Granada started to gather in the central city of Cúcuta. As we will see, none of the delegates, Venezuelan or New Granadan, were exactly thrilled about the union. But they were under strong pressure from Bolívar personally, and they could not help but comply with his wishes. Their informal meetings would give way to a formal session that would run from May to October 1821, and which we will talk about in just 1 minute. ",
            "So after Sucre left, Bolívar went back to trying to recruit and hold together his army because though he was right, that time was on his side, it’s not like desertion wasn’t still constantly a problem. But come the spring of 1821, he probably had somewhere north of 6,000 men spread out across multiple commands in the west where he himself was based and a few thousand more in the far east under General Bermúdez. As I mentioned a few episodes back, it was the loyal General Bermúdez who now ran the eastern provinces as Bolívar had made it clear to the ever-disobedient Santiago Mariño that Mariño was just too good a commander not to be here by Bolívar’s side. Right here, right by my side. ",
            "Now, while the armistice was in effect, Bolívar did his best to hold up his end of the bargain. He was in fairly regular correspondence with General La Torre to keep the lines of communication between the two sides open, and if any republican units got out of line, he issued suitable punishments. But at the end of April, everybody’s hand was forced by one of Bolívar’s subordinate Generals. The General in question is another one of those long-serving revolutionary officers who have been around since the very beginning but who would just muddy the narrative up if I kept naming them name after name. There are a few guys like that roving around out there, but the one who is about to force everybody’s hand is General Rafael Urdaneta. A few years younger than Bolívar, Urdaneta had joined the army way back in 1810 and then linked up with Bolívar at the beginning of the Admirable Campaign and then had been with the Liberator ever since through thick and thin. He’s probably best known today because a huge long bridge across Lake Maracaibo is named after him, the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge. ",
            "Urdaneta was himself a native of the city of Maracaibo, which at that moment was on the royalist side of the armistice line. And at the end of April 1821, he apparently got it into his head that he could successfully orchestrate a local rebellion and bring the city and its surrounding territory over to the republican side. Now, given how loyal Urdaneta was to Bolívar, it’s hard to imagine Bolívar did not know what was going on. But the official story was and is that Bolívar did not sanction the operation. The revolt was successful, however, and Urdaneta evicted the royalists from Maracaibo, whereupon General La Torre issued an ultimatum to Bolívar: give the city back by April 28, or the armistice will be considered null and it’s back to war for everyone. Bolívar begged La Torre to reconsider and apologized profusely for the violation, but then he prepared to go back to war. ",
            "Pretty much as soon as he received the ultimatum, Bolívar issued orders to Urdaneta on the one hand, and José Antonio Páez on the other. Everyone was to convene at the town of San Carlos, which was about 75 miles southwest of Valencia, to prepare for a final push into royalist territory. He also sent an order to the other side of Venezuela for General Bermúdez to prepare a strategic flanking move by directly attacking Caracas and forcing La Torre to peel off troops to defend the capital. Now, at the moment, Caracas wasn’t particularly well garrisoned because it was never the military stronghold that, like, Puerto Cabello was, or even the nearby port of La Guaira was. Now, it would take time for the republicans to get everything in motion, but as April 28th came and went, they still had time to prepare because despite his stern ultimatum, it’s not like General La Torre was itching to come out from behind his walls and attack. ",
            "On May 15, General Bermúdez made the first move of this latest and what would turn out to be final campaign. A fast march from the east took the lightly garrisoned Caracas by surprise. Republican forces entered the city and captured it. But that said, Bermúdez did not really have the men or munitions to hold the city, but that was never the point. The point was to draw royalist attention and that’s exactly what it did. General La Torre dispatched 2,000 men to push Bermúdez out of Caracas, which they did, no problem. But now that was 2,000 fewer men La Torre had when he went to face Bolívar’s army gathering in the west. ",
            "It took a good six weeks for Bolívar to gather that army in the west, with José Antonio Páez and the cavalry coming over from their base in the south-central llanos, Bolívar coming over from his headquarters in Cúcuta, and then General Urdaneta making a difficult march east along the coastline and then south through the sharp ridge of mountains. Along the way, the intrepid Urdaneta captured Coro and squeezed the royalists out of just a bit more territory. On June 11, Páez and Bolívar forces linked at San Carlos, and then Urdaneta arrived a few days later, bringing their total forces up to about 6,500. ",
            "General La Torre was not idle during this period and determined that he needed to march out and put an army between the republicans and what was left of royalist territory. And he identified a spot between the republicans and the city of Valencia as the ideal location, where the high plains of Carabobo gave way to a valley that led into difficult hill country. If Bolívar was planning to advance, there was only one road he could plausibly take, and so, by mid-June, La Torre had planted an army of about 5,000 men on that road, and they waited. ",
            "With the two armies now just 50 miles apart, at the end of June, Bolívar ordered his army forward, approaching what he hoped would be but could not know that it would be the final decisive battle of the war — the Battle of Carabobo. On the night of June 23rd, with contact between the two armies likely coming in the morning, an ominous portent arrived. The heavens opened up, and a torrential rain began to fall. The Venezuelan soldiers were apparently a little spooked by the omen, but in their midst were a couple of hundred British legionaries, many of whom had been veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, and these guys were laughing and high-fiving each other. They said, “Guys, this is actually awesome because the same thing happened before the Battle of Waterloo, and this thing is in the bag.” And so it would be, and as we will see, it will be thanks in large part to that little corps of British soldiers, half of whom would be dead before the next night fell.",
            "The morning of June 24, 1821, dawned with bright blue skies. Bolívar’s army broke camp and approached La Torre’s position from the direction La Torre knew they would be coming from, which is never the greatest way to approach a battle. There is no question that the royalists would be arrayed to meet them. Now, though he was and would remain in love with the reckless frontal assault, Bolívar decided that this was too obvious even for him. So, he decided to go for the trick that had worked so well in the lead-up to the Battle of Boyaca: use supposedly impossible terrain to his advantage.",
            "He divided his army up into three divisions, with about half the total troops being assigned to the division under General Páez. While Bolívar made a slow approach north through the pass La Torre had his eye on, Páez was to make a daring flanking move around to the west through supposedly impassable narrow defiles that gave way to broken and treacherous high ground. Taking a chance on this supposedly impossible terrain so as not to allow the enemy to fight the battle that they wanted to fight, the republicans slowly made their way towards the final battle. There was no good reason for La Torre to suspect that he was about to get flanked, but he was about to get flanked. ",
            "But even still, it’s not like the Battle of Carabobo wasn’t a close-run thing. Páez led his mixture of cavalry and infantry through the impossible terrain, and it wasn’t until they were right on top of the royalists that their presence was discovered. But La Torre acted quickly. He ordered half his army to rearray themselves to face this sudden presence of enemy troops to their right and he turned all his heavy guns in that direction too and just started blasting away. Páez’s forces fought and dodged their way onto the high ground they had been aiming for, but when they then turned to charge into the royalist flank, they ran into a solid wall of battle-hardened royalist infantry, blasting them with a mix of bullets and cannonballs, critically scattering the llaneros cavalry before they could land one of their deadly lance strikes. With Páez and his horsemen pushed back in a cloud of confused buzzing, the whole operation might have been sunk. But those couple of hundred British legionaries stepped into the breach. Later reports said that the British stood like a solid wall, trading fire for fire and enduring heavy casualties. But they prevented the royalists from taking advantage of their initial success and bought Páez and the cavalry time to regroup.",
            "And then, at a critical moment, the British launched a borderline suicidal bayonet charge right into the enemy line, enduring further heavy casualties as they fought. With the bayonet charge pinning the Spanish down, Páez successfully regrouped the cavalry, on the plains behind the Spaniards. So, when they came charging in this time, it was a deadly strike on the royalist rear, and once that charge came, the battle was basically over.",
            "La Torre’s army was now split in two, with the side that had been facing Páez cut off from the side that was still facing the pass where Bolívar’s part of the Republican army was just now emerging. La Torre determined that there would be no saving the day in his current predicament, and he led the half of the army still under his control on an orderly retreat back north across the plains. They never stopped until they got back to the safety of Puerto Cabello. The men he left behind, those who hadn’t been killed anyway, surrendered as soon as they were surrounded. ",
            "I’ve seen different estimates, but of the 5,000 men La Torre had lined up, somewhere between 2,000 and 2,700 were taken prisoner. The republicans only lost a couple of hundred men, and almost all of those were British legionaries—the men who had decisively turned the tide of the battle.",
            "Now, it feels a little petty to point this out, but I’m going to go ahead and do it anyway. In the Battle of Carabobo, the decisive battle in the War of Venezuelan Independence, the battle that secured Venezuelan independence and one of the great victories of all the wars of Spanish American independence, Simón Bolívar himself played no part. ",
            "Now the Liberator was well aware of this, and right there on the spot, he promoted General Páez, the man who had actually won the battle, to General in Chief. In the still somewhat rickety structure of the Republican army, Páez answered now only to Bolívar. Not that that really changed anything — Páez had only ever answered to Bolívar, and even then, only when he felt like it. ",
            "Now it would, of course, take a while to play out, but the Battle of Carabobo was the end of the Spanish in Venezuela. General La Torre simply did not have the forces necessary to prevent Bolívar from doing kind of whatever he wanted. And the royalists were all pulled back to either Puerto Cabello or La Guaira. But though they still hold those last key bases, the Venezuelans now have the run of the whole country. Bolívar himself rode straight for Caracas, entering the capital on June 27, 1821. It was the first time he had set foot in his hometown in seven years, not since the famous evacuation he had been forced to lead in the summer of 1814 when the Legions of Hell were descending, and the Second Republic was collapsing. ",
            "When he entered the city, Bolívar found it silent and hunkered down, the residents not really knowing what had happened out there on the plains of Carabobo, not sure who had won, if the reports of total republican victory were actually true. But word soon filtered out that, yes, the republicans had won and the Liberator was actually here in Caracas. The people slowly emerged from their houses and shops. They saw that all was indeed well, that Bolívar was there, and triumphant. So shortly thereafter, silence gave way to cheers and then celebrations and then a long-running, boisterous party. ",
            "Bolívar himself went straight to his old house, a piece of property that had long since been confiscated by the enemy but was now his to rightfully reclaim. Now, I can’t find any reports of what state the Caracas house was in, but in general, Bolívar had been financially ruined by the revolution. The various businesses and estates that had been in the Bolívar family going back to the Conquest had been confiscated years ago, and those that he might now reclaim were mostly in ruins.",
            "For Bolívar personally, the end result of his life as a revolutionary was clear. He had gone from being one of the richest men in Venezuela to being all but destitute. And this was a problem for him exacerbated because of his high-minded virtuous republicanism. He was consciously emulating the career of George Washington, and Bolívar refused, for example, to accept wages for his service either as Commander in Chief of the army or president of the Republic. But whereas Washington could actually afford this kind of republican chivalry, Bolívar really couldn’t. And now that the war was winding down, it was becoming clear just how bad off he was. ",
            "But even facing this down, he was not deterred from setting a virtuous example. And shortly after arriving in Caracas, he decided to do General Washington one better. Bolívar rode out to the old San Mateo estate, the one that he had once been besieged at by Boves and the Legions of Hell. This estate was still clunking along under the labor of about 100 slaves working underpaid overseers. Bolívar showed up and announced that all the slaves were now free. He really did embrace emancipation after his time in Haiti, and he hoped that his example of personally emancipating his own slaves would spark a similar run of emancipation by his fellow owners. But predictably, his lead was not followed. It was a magnificent personal gesture on Bolívar’s part, but the other slave-owning revolutionaries refused to take the economic hit. Bolívar took the hit, despite being one of the poorest of all the senior revolutionaries, because for him, the principle of the thing really was now more important than any base material considerations.",
            "A few weeks after the Battle of Carabobo, the Congress in Cúcuta, the Constitutional Convention, announced that they had now finished the new new constitution for the Republic of Colombia — a constitution that, as I just hinted, none of them were particularly happy with. But they felt like they had to set things up to match the desires of Bolívar rather than their own desires, even if Bolívar was not himself going to be 100% satisfied with the job they had done.",
            "If you remember back to our four quadrants of Spanish American revolutionaries — republican monarchist axis, centralist federalist axis. Well, the monarchist half of that equation has been dead for going on a decade now, but almost everyone else was some version of republican federalist, with Bolívar himself remaining one of the few staunch centralists. For him, the Republic of Colombia could only work if it existed under one single central government. But as I’ve said, despite the fact that he kept harping on this point, no one else ever really agreed with him. They all wanted a decentralized government and for whatever union might exist between New Granada and Venezuela, and then maybe Quito in the future, that it should be nominal at best. Venezuelans did not want to answer to New Granadans, and vice versa. But the Liberator was so singularly insistent on the point of central government that in the end, the Constitution was centralist. ",
            "The model that the Congress took looked a lot like the United States. There were three branches of government: an executive President and Vice-president, a legislative Senate and House of Representatives, and an independent judiciary. And like the United States, at least at the time, the Congress was supposed to be the dominant branch, responsible for all legislation and in whose hands most final decisions lay. The President was there to execute their laws and only had minimal unilateral authority during a state emergency. The judiciary, though they made very strong and independent as most of the men in the room, were lawyers who did not unreasonably think that the rule of law was of primary importance to a new republic. They also tried to break free of the old borders, at least on paper, by abolishing the distinction between Venezuela and New Granada and instead creating a bunch of departments that would each be run by an intendant who answered to the central government. But those old distinctions were going to prove impossible to paper over. Finally, as we’ve seen before, and as would be natural for men of their pedigree, the active-passive citizen distinction was maintained, and suffrage would be based on a property qualification.",
            "When Bolívar was given the draft that they had voted on in mid-July 1821, he was disappointed. As he had stressed since the Cartagena Manifesto, he did not believe his countrymen were quite ready for the responsibility that came with a government run by a committee of elected representatives reliant on blind trust in lawyers and judges. He continued to believe that a vigorous and empowered executive was what the situation required — somebody to cut through all the crap, hold the factions together, and keep the greedy and self-interested men in check while giving the republic enough breathing room to survive.",
            "But it’s important to note that, again, like George Washington, Bolívar did not want to be that man. At least that’s what he said over and over and over again. And I get the feeling like, if nothing else, he really didn’t want to do the job, like dealing with civilian politics, issuing memos, and managing the implementation of laws like Santander seemed to love. But even then, it’s easy to be skeptical of Bolívar’s “Oh, I don’t really want power. Okay, I’ll take power.” But if a guy does say the same thing over and over again, I do think it’s worth taking him at his word.",
            "Bolívar believed that as a military man, a man of war, that vesting him above all others with civilian power was a dangerous thing. Somebody needed that power, but it really shouldn’t be me. He said, ",
            "“You tell me that history will say great things about me. I believe that it will say nothing was greater than my renunciation of power and my absolute dedication to the arms that could save the government and the country. History will say, ‘Bolívar took over the government to free his countrymen, and when they were free, he left them so that they would be ruled by law and not by his will.’”",
            "But Bolívar’s election to the presidency was unavoidable. He was the indispensable man. And so, when the congress elected him president on September 7, 1821, with Santander elected vice president, there was nothing Bolívar could do but accept. Though when he rode to Cúcuta to accept the presidency, he did so with a light admonishing of the Congress that he really should not be president. He said, ",
            "“I am a son of war, the man whom combat has raised to government. A man like me is a dangerous citizen for a popular government, a threat to national sovereignty.” ",
            "And so, acting on his own convictions, Bolívar basically made himself a figurehead president, with the day-to-day operations of the new Republic of Colombia left in the capable hands of Vice President Santander. Bolívar himself then turned his attention back to war, the state within which he felt most comfortable and where his ultimate ambitions had not yet been satisfied. There was still Quito to acquire for the Republic of Colombia. And then, he wanted to move south to Peru to secure the final expulsion of the Spanish from all of South America. The War of Venezuelan Independence may be over, but for Bolívar, the war went on. ",
            "But that said, most of the men who had fought and died with him all these years were now rounding up their own service, and they were starting to relax and think about what to do in their new world of independent peace. So, while Bolívar went back to planning the next phase of his military career, which we’ll talk about more next week, I want to wrap up today by talking a little bit about the country Bolívar would be leaving behind. Because though the war would go on for him, for everyone else, the time had now come to see what it meant to live in a free and independent country. ",
            "So, this is going to bring us all the way back around to the racial and class structures that we had talked about existing at the beginning of the revolution. It’s now basically time to check up and see how everyone is faring now that liberty is at hand.",
            "At the top of the old pyramid, we can clear those guys out right away because it’s the peninsulares. The peninsulares are gone now. Now, that doesn’t mean that men and women from Spain won’t remain in the Republic of Colombia now that it has been liberated, just that any special privileges or access to office or any other economic and social benefits they once enjoyed, those are now gone. That very top of the old hierarchy just got lopped off and tossed into the bin. If you were a Spaniard and decided to stay, that was fine, but you were just another white guy.",
            "So, who stepped up to the top of the pyramid? Well, the old criollo aristocracy, of course. Now, this was not a reward that had been gained without major cost. At least in Venezuela, the estimate is that over the course of the War of Independence, the white population had been reduced by about half, with death and exile taking their toll on the white population. So, to emerge victorious in the new order, you are going to have to have been one of the ones who lived. But those that did live slid naturally into all the major governmental and administrative posts and had money and capital to take advantage of the postwar economic environment where land and opportunity could be had on the cheap. Even a guy like Bolívar, who, as I just said, at least on paper, was now totally destitute in 1821, well he had all the clout he needed to not have his lack of funds really get in the way if he didn’t want them to.",
            "But that old criollo aristocracy did have to deal with one group pushing their way in to join them at the top. Men who had not been a part of the elite prior to the wars, and that was the senior military officers. Now, of course, some of those guys, again Bolívar chief among them, but also guys like Santiago Mariño and Santander had already been a part of the criollo aristocracy. But there were other poor whites who had joined the army and risen up well beyond their original station. General Bermúdez was a good example of that, but of course, the best example is Jose Antonio Páez. The poor, barefoot llanero was now General in Chief of the Republican army and at the moment, one of the dozen or so most powerful men in all of South America. His kind of self-made caudillos were not exactly embraced by the more genteel criollo. But their military service gave them claim to both property and power that made them an undeniable force to be reckoned with. And in fact, at the end of the day, they were the power to be reckoned with because the course of history in Venezuela and Colombia, it’s the story of military strongmen lording it over the civilian government.",
            "But then there was another group that also felt resistant to their ascension to power in the new order, and they felt it even more acutely. This was mixed-race military officers. Remember, about half the population was some version of pardo, that is, a mix of black and white. Most of the pardos were still trapped in the lower classes, and we’ll get to them in a second. But at least a few had joined the army, served with distinction, been elevated at rank, and were now being discharged with legitimate claims to property, status, and influence that would have been unheard of before the revolution.",
            "But the reality faced by these rising pardos gets to the core of the problem of race in postrevolutionary Spanish America. The Constitution of Colombia was explicit on the matter. There were no races in Colombia. There was only citizens, and everyone was equal to everyone else. While the pardos were quick to discover that this ideal did not really translate into reality, and they found themselves consistently maltreated by their supposedly white equals.",
            "Remember, in the final years of the Bourbon Reforms, the Spanish administrators had been the ones pushing to roll back the strict racial caste system that had defined the old order. In fact, one of the reasons the white criollo had resented peninsular administration was that the peninsulares were trying to make the pardos equal of the whites, and the whites didn’t like it. Well, as these new rising pardos tried to transition their children, for example, into being full and equal citizens, giving them access to schools and opportunities, the de jure racism that had defined the old hierarchy was still de facto in effect, even as grand proclamations of racial equality accompanied every patriotic speech.",
            "But at least that handful of pardo officers had the means to live better, even if they were still up the creek socially. The vast majority of their lower-class brothers and sisters, though, found themselves even worse off than they had been on the eve of the revolution. Well, now that the peninsulares were gone, there was no one looking out for the interests of poor pardos anymore, and their status took a decided step back after independence. Again, they were considered equal under the law, but since almost all of them lacked property qualifications to vote, their interests would be virtually ignored by the post-independence government. And in the years to come, periodic revolts and unrest driven by a mixed-race population demanding that the promise of equality be redeemed dot the history of free Colombia.",
            "Now, the group that should have been able to make a decent jump in status were the enlisted soldiers, both white and pardo who had served throughout the wars of independence. But as is often the case, those guys got majorly shortchanged. When wages ran low, they started being paid in land titles by their Generals, and when the whole system was centralized, they started being paid in vouchers that would be redeemable for land at some indeterminate point in the future once the war was over. Well, as had happened with the government bonds paid to enlisted continentals during the American War of Independence, what could a common soldier do with these vouchers? They couldn’t eat them, they couldn’t drink them. And so what happened? That’s right, in come the speculators who are offering cash for as low as 5% of face value for the vouchers. But if you’re a poor enlisted man who needs to buy some food, you sell no matter how low the price. This meant that when the war ended, men who already had means came away with claims to huge amounts of land while all the men who had done the fighting and risked death walked away virtually empty-handed. And this is part of the reason why none of them now have the vote; they had no property to speak of, so their interests too were ignored. And since the constitution put a strong emphasis on private property rights and the judiciary was strict about enforcement, there was no real solution.",
            "“I mean, you sold your voucher, right?”",
            "“Yes, sir.”",
            "“Well, that means it’s his property now. End of the story. Next case.”",
            "So in terms of economic and social leveling, the revolution in Colombia left an awful lot to be desired. And this leaving of an awful lot to be desired extended to the issue of slavery because what were they going to do with the slaves? ",
            "Bolívar was adamant and would remain adamant that they all needed to be freed. And he used every ounce of his stature and his influence to get the slaves freed without any kind of deep concern about what the economic or social repercussions might be. But as I just mentioned, none of his fellow slave owners were much interested in following Bolívar’s lead. And despite a vague nod to emancipation in the constitution, the government had little interest in following through. ",
            "They wrote up a little subsection outlining the process for emancipation, with an emphasis on how to compensate owners for their lost property, a special tax would be instituted that would then create a fund that could pay owners for freeing their slaves. But in practice, this was all a dead letter. Nobody wanted to pay the tax, no one fought too hard to collect the tax, and so no owner freed his slaves because he wasn’t going to be compensated. ",
            "So despite Bolívar’s begging, pleading, and cajoling, slavery stayed entrenched in the Republic of Colombia. They did, however, write in that it would be phased out over time, that children of slaves would be freed as soon as they turned 18. Later, this would be bumped up to 21. So in the free Republic of Colombia, and then in the independent nations that would follow in the wake of Bolívar’s death, slaves were still slaves.",
            "Finally, there were the native Amerindian populations who have, for the most part, been completely on the sidelines through all of this. Their population was not nearly as large in Gran Colombia as it was, for example, in Peru, but those who were around were none too thrilled with independence. As I’ve mentioned, they were subject to a special tribute as a community but were simultaneously exempt from all other taxation. In the new order, they were now, quote unquote, “freed” from the tribute but liable for all the other taxes, which ran quite a bit higher. And as if that wasn’t enough, the more liberal economics of the new nation emphasized individual property rights at the expense of any kind of communal ownership. So the rhythm of Amerindian life was about to be severely disrupted, as every plot of land now required an individual name on an individual deed. And if you didn’t have that, it was pretty easy for some speculator to move on in. ",
            "But as I’ve said, how this complicated web of social, economic, and political forces would work themselves out in the months and years after independence, Bolívar himself did not plan to be around to guide it, because his years as a revolutionary had broadened his vision. It was no longer just Venezuela or Gran Colombia that fit Bolívar’s definition of the country that he would liberate or die trying, but all of South America. As long as a single South American was in Spanish chains, Bolívar himself would not be free. ",
            "So, next week will mark the beginning of his pivot south on his way to his fateful meeting with General José de San Martín and the liberation of all of South America. Now, to tell that story, we have to go back and pick up with San Martín. So next week will mostly be a follow-up to Episode 5.13 to catch up with San Martín and Bernardo O’Higgins after the liberation of Chile. "

            "Last time, we finally liberated Venezuela from the Spanish. After the great republican victory at Carabobo, Venezuela was now independent, and the future of unified Gran Colombia began to take shape. But as I mentioned at the end of the episode, Simón Bolívar himself did not plan to be on hand to shape that future, at least not for the moment. He wanted to keep moving. Liberating the ancient city of Quito was now his immediate goal, and he spoke openly and often about wanting to add a third sister to join his triumphs at Boyacá and Carabobo. Once Quito had been brought into the Gran Colombian fold, Bolívar then planned to keep moving south into Peru to complete the liberation of South America. And for all the high-minded reasons Bolívar had for continuing to drive himself, there was under it all a strong undercurrent of professional jealousy. ",
            "For years now, Bolívar had been getting reports of the progress of General José de San Martín down in the south. By the fall of 1821, San Martín had forged a professional army, marched them through the Andes, liberated Chile, and was now sitting in Lima, Peru, after successfully invading the last viceroyalty on the continent. Bolívar had followed these reports with a mixture of excitement and fear. Excitement, of course, that a man as talented as San Martín not only shared Bolívar’s vision of Pan-American liberation but was pulling it off. But also fear, because as Bolívar was getting these reports, especially early on in 1816 and 1817 and 1818, Bolívar himself was stuck in the mud, and he was deathly afraid of being eclipsed, that the world would remember the name San Martín and forget the name Bolívar.",
            "And it was this mix of excitement and fear that helped fuel Bolívar’s half-mad brush up into the mountains in 1819 to liberate New Granada. His own personal ego simply could not handle the thought of being left behind. But the last few years had been good for Bolívar, and on the plains of Carabobo, he finally liberated his homeland, and the free nation of Gran Colombia, which now encompassed most of northern South America, was secure. And with this success in hand, Bolívar turned his own attention south. And he was soon gathering an army to march first on Quito, and then, when that city was hopefully liberated, to go on forward and link with San Martín, where together, as equals, they could decide the fate of South America.",
            "So, as I mentioned a little ways back, though, I’m pretty much making the schedule up as I go right now, as I try to juggle finishing the book and producing episodes to keep up my obligations to you, my faithful listeners. So this week, we’re going to pick up where we left off back in Episode 5.13, when we talked all about Chile and Argentina and go forward to cover the final liberation of Chile and take San Martín up to the brink of his invasion of Peru. Then next week, we’ll be back for a shorter episode that will detail the rather crazy life of Alexander Cochrane, the brilliant, if combative Scottish captain who would wind up commanding San Martín’s navy. And then we’ll follow them all through the invasion of Peru from the south as Bolívar starts making his own way down from the north.",
            "So it’s been a few episodes since we’ve talked about events in the south, and it probably wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to go back and relisten to Episode 5.13 in preparation for today’s episode. But just to recap a little: after the May Revolution of 1810 in Buenos Aires, the old viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata had fallen into a multi faction conflict that boiled down mostly to Buenos Aires trying to control the whole of the old viceroyalty and everyone else resisting them – a conflict that was in particular defined by the rivalry between Buenos Aires and the nearby city of Montevideo. This conflict resolved itself, at least temporarily, in 1814, with the triumph of Buenos Aires and the egalitarian Uruguayan patriot José Artigas winding up in control of Montevideo.",
            "Meanwhile, on the other side of the Andes, Chile had had its own independence revolution at the end of 1810 that had unfortunately also given way to regional friction, with a faction of patriots up north in Santiago running into trouble with their brothers to the south in Concepción. Alternating between fighting each other and fighting off various Spanish reinvasions, the Patria Vieja, the old fatherland, had ultimately fallen after the Battle of Rancagua in October 1814, that’s when Bernardo O’Higgins ordered his army to run for it, but only the cavalry could actually run for it and everybody else was killed. Remember all that? Good.",
            "O’Higgins and the other Chilean patriots had fled west across the Andes for the safety of Argentina. And there they were welcomed with open arms by the governor of the frontier province of Cuyo, General José de San Martín. ",
            "So that’s right about where we left things off in 1815. And though the names and faces would change and change again, in the Río de la Plata, the basic rivalry between Montevideo and Buenos Aires continued to define events going forward. José Artigas, the egalitarian leader of the peasants and cowboys of the interior, now controlled Montevideo. And in defiance of the centralists in Buenos Aires, who were soon called the unitarians (no relation), Artigas established a rival Federal League, a government that promised decentralized confederate government rather than outright submission to the guys in Buenos Aires. They each vied for the loyalty of the interior provinces and likely would have begun a shooting war with each other, but eventually, a new player crashed into the scene, and that was the Portuguese. ",
            "Now, we haven’t talked much about the Portuguese because, well, there’s been everything else to talk about. But remember, the Portuguese royal family had fled Europe back during Napoleon’s original invasions in 1807 and they still made their capital in Río de Janeiro. Well, now that Waterloo has come and gone, the Portuguese ruling elite had some decisions to make. And for now, they were like, well, Portugal is nice, but to a certain degree, Brazil really is a better, richer and more powerful place to base our empire. And so they moved to eliminate any kind of mother country colony distinction between their holdings in Europe and the Americas.",
            "But the end of the Napoleonic Wars did encourage them to start thinking about growing Portuguese power again, rather than just retaining what they already had. And the new king decided that capturing Montevideo and annexing the Banda Oriental was a great place to start, as it would give Portugal control of all the territory north of the Río de la Plata. And so, in March of 1816, the Portuguese invaded the Banda Oriental, and it was an invasion that would submerge the region in five-plus years of war and would eventually end with the defeat of Artigas’s people and the occupation of the Banda Oriental by the Portuguese. This occupation would then last until 1828, until another round of war expelled what had by then become the Empire of Brazil, and the independent nation of Uruguay was established.",
            "Meanwhile, on the southern side of the Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires was having enormous difficulties of its own, as its compulsive centralizing efforts were resisted far and wide. The Federal League, run by Artigas, and the now totally autonomous Paraguay, run by Dr. Francia, refused to let Buenos Aires call the shots. And then inside Buenos Aires, rival factions battled it out for power, and a run of regime changes and coups and counter-coups swapped leaders around and made true unity and centralization all but impossible. It was quite a mess, and in early 1816, factions inside of Buenos Aires called on José de San Martín to take the reins of power, but he didn’t want the job. Instead, he pushed for them to establish a new congress that would declare formal independence from Spain, something they hadn’t actually done yet, and then write a new centralist constitution for the job of the supreme dictator of the United Provinces, which is what they were now calling themselves, San Martín backed an ally of his named Juan Martín de Pueyrredón, who would support San Martín’s plans in Buenos Aires while leaving San Martín himself free to pursue them. ",
            "Since it is those plans above all that we are interested in here today, we should move now to San Martín, who has set himself up as governor of the interior province of Cuyo, which ran right up against the steep Andes to the west. Now, for those who did not know San Martín, the governorship of a backwater province far removed from the action seemed a very strange job to cling to, especially when people are routinely asking you to come be the supreme dictator of the United Provinces. But people who did know him knew exactly why he was there. Far removed from the endless political strife of the coastline, San Martín was busy turning Cuyo into his own personal war machine.",
            "Now, San Martín was, by all accounts, also an excellent and conscientious administrator, and the population of Cuyo came to genuinely admire him. But his whole purpose for being there was to prepare for an invasion of Chile, which lay just on the other side of the mountains. And so, from this population that came to love and admire him, San Martín turned all their attention towards his dream. And right now, that dream was building up something he now called his Army of the Andes.",
            "The Army of the Andes started with a small contingent of cavalry assigned to him by his friends in Buenos Aires, about 700 men, but no more. To this, San Martín was able to add the Chilean refugees who had come over the mountains in 1814, chief among them Bernardo O’Higgins and José Miguel Carrera. The Chilean patriots were, of course, thrilled to discover that Governor San Martín wanted nothing more than to help them re-liberate their homeland. Though Carrera soon became disaffected as San Martín and O’Higgins fell into an easy partnership that rankled Carrera to no end.",
            "San Martín then set about recruiting from the local population, with a special emphasis on the mixed-race pardo and mestizo populations. And then, when it became clear that something more drastic was necessary, he filled out his infantry with freed black slaves. As I mentioned in passing back in Episode 5.14, this was just around the same time Bolívar was putting it together up in the north that a revolution by and for the criollo was a dead end. San Martín was way ahead of him, and the Army of the Andes turned out to be one of the blackest nonwhite armies in all of South America. Even the officer corps was not the lily-white enclave it usually was.",
            "By the end of 1816, San Martín had raised somewhere around 5,000 men. ",
            "But it wasn’t just men that San Martín needed; it was everything. And like a little levée en masse, San Martín turned Cuyo into a war machine. San Martín’s attention to logistical detail and careful preparation put him in marked contrast with the more romantic windmill tilting that seemed to define Bolívar’s career. So San Martín didn’t have enough gunpowder? Fine. He sent his people out to gather the necessary ingredients and then taught them how to make him gunpowder. He also said, “We don’t have cannons, so here’s how you have to melt things down to get the necessary metal, and here’s how you cast the forges, and here’s how you do it. Get to work. Build me cannons. We also need cannonballs; we need wheels and axles and carts; we need shoes.” San Martín set up textile factories to weave cloth to make him uniforms, and blankets, and coats. He also started mass-producing portable food stuff that would sustain his army through the desolate stretches of the mountains. His people would make food, then dry it out and grind it into a powder like proto freeze-dried meals that required only the addition of some hot water to turn it into a meal.",
            "So where Bolívar had been forced to run his war with captured supplies and what could be procured on the black market, San Martín grew, manufactured, and assembled everything himself. The entire economy of Cuyo was now built around building his army.",
            "The other place that San Martín’s preparation shined through was in his intelligence operations, both in the acquisition of knowledge about the enemy, the terrain and conditions out there, but also the dissemination of counterintelligence to keep his enemy off guard. Using a wide network of spies and making productive alliances with the native Amerindian communities, San Martín soon acquired extensive knowledge about the terrain, and enemy fortifications, and the political situation on the other side of the mountains. He wanted to know everything about what he might be possibly marching into. ",
            "But he was also interested in spreading outright lies about what he was up to. And this was a game that he loved to play with the royalists in Chile, now aware that invasion was possibly in the making, San Martín started sending out fake orders. He would reassign units here and then send them over there. He would pretend to have made contact with Chilean guerrillas in the south. Then he would clearly set the stage to go through a pass over here, but no, now maybe over here. Even his own officers were often confused about what the plan actually was. The effect was to throw the Spanish army in Chile into dispersed confusion. It was like softening them up with a steady barrage of artillery fire. And the Spanish ultimately concluded, thanks to a few more moves that San Martín made at the end of 1816, that he would do the logical thing and take the shortest pass through the mountains in the south. So it should come as no surprise to us that San Martín was actually planning to take the longer pass to the north.",
            "Now, one thing that is worth noting in all this is that even with all of his careful preparations and intelligence operations, this was still a crazy plan. Nobody had ever marched an army through this stretch of the Andes. It was some of the steepest and roughest country in the whole great range. There were a lot of skeptics out there, even among his close allies, about whether or not this thing could actually be pulled off. But San Martín was convinced that it could be done, and he was possibly aided by a small fact that I have not yet told you about Jose de San Martín. He was an opium addict.",
            "Now, he came by his opium addiction honestly. He suffered from rheumatism and frequent bouts of stomach pain, and his doctors prescribed laudanum, which is basically liquid opium, as a painkiller, and it became a constant presence in his life. Now, people apparently still argue about whether San Martín was an addict per se, but he was never without his little vials of laudanum. An aides recalled him rolling out of bed and knocking back a slug first thing every morning and then just re-upping as needed throughout the day. Now, he was never a let’s-lay-around-in-bed-and-compose-bad-poetry opium head. San Martín was highly functional, but still, you do have to remember that through all of this, as San Martín is trying to do all of these things that he’s trying to do, and then even when he does them, he’s pretty much mildly zonked on opium the whole time.",
            "With all his years of preparation now complete, though, on January 19, 1817, San Martín and the Army of the Andes began their march into the mountains. The final numbers were 5,200 men, 1,600 cavalry horses, and over 10,000 mules. San Martín personally led the main column, with Bernardo O’Higgins managing the rear guard, while smaller units took alternate routes to keep the enemy off balance and never quite knowing where San Martín was going to emerge. ",
            "Now, remember, though, that because we’re in the southern hemisphere, a January launch date means that this is the height of summer, not the dead of winter. I mean, San Martín is not so whacked out on opium that he thinks it’s a good idea to march into the mountains in winter, but still, the going was not going to be easy. This was not going to be like a 72-hour sprint as Bolívar’s own crossing would be a few years later; the distance was greater, the pass is higher, and he had way more men and equipment to deal with. So the Army of the Andes proceeded slowly, day after day, climbing higher and higher. And even though it was summer, the cold started to set in and then problems with altitude sickness began. Mules and horses started dying of malnutrition and cold, and then men started following them. But they all kept going because there was nothing else to be done. ",
            "It took fully three weeks to emerge on the other side of the Andes frozen, exhausted, and malnourished. But they had done it. The Army of the Andes sustained its share of casualties, and more animals than San Martín hoped had died along the way. But José de San Martín had just successfully marched an army through the Andes, which he had been told time and time again just couldn’t be done. And even more impressively, they emerged ready to fight. Not that his men wanted to fight, but when they emerged into Chile at the Chacabuco plains, they basically landed right on top of a 1,500-man Spanish garrison. A garrison that was far closer to the pass than San Martín had expected. And he had two choices; he could either let his men recuperate and risk a mass of Spanish reinforcements converging on top of them, or he could order an attack right now while he still had the numerical advantage. Confident that he had trained his men well, he ordered them to prepare for battle. ",
            "The royalists bore a raid below them on the plains of Chacabuco centered around a fortified ranch house. Late in the evening on February 11, San Martín ordered 2,000 of his men forward in two columns. A 500-man contingent under one of his chief lieutenants, a guy named Miguel Soler, were to take a long circuitous route around to the right while Bernardo O’Higgins took 1,500 men around to the left. They were supposed to converge on the enemy at dawn and attack as soon as both were in position. But on the morning of February 12, 1817, O’Higgins suddenly led his men in a direct attack on the royalists before Soler’s men had reached their position. And apparently interpretations of O’Higgins differ, whether you are a Chilean or an Argentinian patriot. The Argentinians say that O’Higgins got all fired up being back home and he wanted to rush forward and grab all the glory for himself and nearly wrecked San Martín’s plans. Chileans, meanwhile, follow O’Higgins’s own explanation that he had emerged from the hills and was hit by a royalist advance no one had expected. And had he retreated, his men would have been picked off one by one trying to get back up the trail they had come down. So, it was either get slaughtered or charged forward. And so he had charged. And it all turns out to be an academic debate, though, because O’Higgins’ charge was not a disaster. Soler was finally able to swing around in position, cutting off any royalist retreat. The Spaniards formed a defensive square, but could only hold out for so long, and soon it collapsed under vicious, hand-to-hand fighting.",
            "So despite O’Higgins jumping the gun, the Battle of Chacabuco turned out to be a rout: 500 royalists dead, another 600 taken prisoner, while the Army of the Andes lost only twelve dead and 120 wounded. But more importantly, the road to Santiago was now wide open. ",
            "When the Spanish governor in Santiago was told that this liberating army had appeared out of the mountains and decisively won at Chacabuco, he recognized that his position was untenable and ordered an evacuation. The Army of the Andes then advanced and took the capital unopposed just a few days later. The jubilant inhabitants embraced their liberators, and a hastily cobbled-together provisional government immediately tried to make General José de San Martín supreme dictator of Chile, a job he had no interest in accepting. He said, “I’ve come here to liberate the Chileans, not rule them.” So he pointed them to Bernardo O’Higgins and said, “There is your man.” And so Bernardo O’Higgins became the supreme dictator of Chile. ",
            "San Martín, meanwhile, focused on the next stage of his own grand plans — the invasion of Peru by sea. But there was just one problem: he didn’t have a navy, and, for the moment, the Chileans were in no position to provide one. So after recuperating from the campaign, San Martín left O’Higgins to see to things in Chile, while he himself made the long trip back to Buenos Aires to raise money and ships. ",
            "Upon his return to the Río de la Plata, San Martín was welcomed as a hero and feted wherever he went. But he quickly found it hard to turn his newfound fame into tangible support. The whole region had devolved still further since the last time he had been there, with Portugal pushing into the Banda Oriental and José Artigas in the Federal League resisting both the Portuguese on the one hand and the United Provinces on the other. For Buenos Aires to peel off money and supplies to ship over for some faraway campaign against Peru, that was the last thing on any of their minds. Even San Martín’s ally, Pueyrredón, couldn’t deliver on promises he had made to San Martín to keep up the pressure on the Spanish after liberating Chile. There just wasn’t enough to go around, and what was around needed to be kept here at home. ",
            "Disappointed and angry with the meager support, San Martín then got news that things on the other side of the Andes were not going very well. The supposed mop-up operations in the south of Chile that were meant to clear out the last royalist strongholds turned out to be anything but mop-up operations, and a combination of unexpected royalist strength and patriot mismanagement meant that there was now a real possibility that the gains they had all made the previous year were going to be reversed. So San Martín headed back across the mountains. ",
            "But when he got to Santiago, he still tried to keep his own personal focus on building up a navy and preparing for his further push north, hoping that O’Higgins would be able to handle things in the south. But it was not to be. As had happened during the wars of the Patria Vieja, the viceroy in Peru was not going to let Chile just slip away. And so, in January 1818, 5,000 royalist troops landed outside Concepción, and San Martín had to set aside his planned invasion of Peru to go deal with an invasion from Peru. ",
            "As he pivoted his army around and tried to muster local Chilean forces to go block the royalist march up the coast towards Santiago, San Martín urged O’Higgins and the Chilean government to make a resolution to declare independence formally, which they had not yet done. The hope being that this would give a little patriotic spark of life to the coming campaign. So on February 12, 1818, the first anniversary of the Battle of Chacabuco, Chile declared independence. Now, these days, Chile celebrates their original September 1810 meetings as the beginning of independence, but thanks to San Martín, this latest declaration would be the one that stuck for good.",
            "By the beginning of March, San Martín’s Army of the Andes had combined with native Chilean troops to form an army about 6,000 strong, split into three divisions. But the campaign did not start well. The division led by O’Higgins, about 1,700 men total, was camped at a spot called Cancha Rayada when they were hit with a surprise night attack on March 19. In the midst of the attack, the patriot cattle stampeded, causing even further destructive chaos and O’Higgins himself was shot in the shoulder by a musket ball and badly wounded. The rout was complete, and the Chilean forces fled in panic. Now, when word of this debacle reached Santiago, terror took hold because this is exactly how the beginning of the end of the Patria Vieja had gone. ",
            "But despite what now felt like the inevitable fall of Santiago, the defeat at Cancha Rayada was not as bad as it looked. A surprisingly large number of troops made it back to the city unhurt and uncaptured. They only lost a few hundred men in all. The royalists had then apparently decided to get sidetracked sacking a smaller city nearby rather than keeping up the pressure on the capital. Then, five days after the battle, Supreme Dictator O’Higgins himself finally arrived back in town, arm in a sling, but defiant and ready to muster every available resource to save the country from reconquest. Now, General San Martín was himself already in Santiago, directing the defenses of the city, but he wanted to go out and meet the enemy. And he had identified the plains of Maipú, just on the other side of the Maipo River, a few miles southwest of Santiago, as the best place where he might possibly be making his last stand. ",
            "So, leaving the injured O’Higgins in charge of Santiago, San Martín led out somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 men. Like always, accounts differ about the final troop numbers. And on April 5, 1818, he made contact with the royalists on the plains of Maipú. The royalist army was about the same size as his own: they numbered somewhere around 5,000. And San Martín calmly allowed them to cross the river unopposed and then apparently watched with delight as they moved over to try to position themselves on the main road to Santiago, entering terrain that San Martín believed would be perfect for a trap. And it was that trap that would prove to be his finest hour as a general. ",
            "His military intelligence being what it was, San Martín knew that the royalists would line up their best regiments on their right wing with their weaker regiments on the left. Rather than meeting strength with strength, San Martín lined up his own men the same way, with his weakest on the left and strongest on the right. This meant that each side would be pitting their best men against the enemy’s worst men. When battle was joined, things then proceeded as you might expect. The stronger wings pushed back their weaker opponents, and soon the whole battle line was turning in a big counterclockwise motion. ",
            "So what’s so great about that? Well, San Martín had placed his cavalry in reserve, and as soon as the crack royalist troops got aggressively overextended, San Martín ordered his reserve cavalry to swing around at high speed and blast their now completely exposed rear flank. And this turned out to be a death strike. The best royalist troops were obliterated, while their weaker comrades over on the other side of the battle were routed without further difficulty. The fight for the center remained hotly contested for a few hours as the royalists formed defensive squares and did their best to hold out. But by then, it was hopeless. ",
            "When the dust and the smoke and the fury cleared, the scope of the victory became apparent. The royalists had marched in with 5,000 men, and of those, fully 2,000 now lay dead, with another 2,200 captured. That is, almost the entire royalist expeditionary army was now gone.",
            "Now, this had not come without great costs, as a thousand patriots also lay dead. But there was obviously not going to be an endless supply of reinforcements coming from Peru and the loss of this entire army at the Battle of Maipú marked the end of any realistic shot the Spanish had of reclaiming Chile. ",
            "Famously, the injured Bernardo O’Higgins could not take just sitting around in Santiago for long, and he rode out to take stock of the battle, arriving just as it was winding down. Arm still in a sling, he thundered out onto the field where he found San Martín, and the two Generals embraced in a great big, glorious hug. ",
            "The victory at Maipú was, as I said, San Martín’s finest hour as a General, and he was once again feted as the great hero of Spanish American independence, second to none, not even Bolívar, who was himself at that point still ensconced in Angostura. And when Bolívar got word of all of San Martín’s victories in the middle of 1818, his mind really started racing about the need to invade New Granada to keep up with his revolutionary colleague to the south. ",
            "But this latest exploit really just got San Martín back to the place he thought he already was: with Chile secured and him preparing for the invasion of Peru, which meant going back to trying to cobble together a navy, which was slowly but surely coming together. ",
            "In mid-1818, San Martín traveled back to Buenos Aires to request further money, support, men, and ships, but found the situation even further deteriorated than the last time he had been there. And the boys in Buenos Aires were able to provide very little in the realm of material aid. And in fact, now that Chile did seem to be fully liberated, there was talk that the Army of the Andes really needed to come home to help them secure victory over Artigas’ Federal League, which continued to make both political and military inroads. And that was to say nothing of the rumor going around — the very true rumor, I might add — that back in Europe, the Spanish were amassing 20,000 men whose destination would be the Río de la Plata. ",
            "So what the government in Buenos Aires really wanted now was for San Martín to come home. But San Martín did not want to do it. He knew that the Army of the Andes would be used first and foremost in the service of one particular faction in a civil war that seemed ready to break out at any moment, and he did not want to waste his army on such a fratricidal venture. The Army of the Andes was an army for all Americans, for everyone to join together and fight the Spaniards — not to impose the will of one faction on another. I mean, San Martín sympathized with Buenos Aires, and he himself preferred a strong central government, but call off the invasion of Peru just to come back and kill Argentinians? No way. ",
            "After multiple resignation threats, San Martín was finally able to squeeze some money out of the government because he was able to instill in them the fear that their greatest hero, their greatest General, might sever his ties to them completely. Although a year later, that’s exactly what he would do. ",
            "So, for the rest of the year, preparations for the invasion of Peru continued, and a small patriot fleet was coming together in Chile. Then, in November of 1818, a crucial piece of the puzzle fell into place when a charismatic Scottish captain by the name of Thomas Cochrane arrived to take overall command of the fleet. And next week, we’ll cover the adventurous life of Cochrane before following him to Chile and then following everyone up to Peru. ",
            "But to finish up here though, in May of 1819, the government in Buenos Aires promulgated its completed constitution, which was as centralist a document as they could possibly write, and it sparked fury in the provinces. Many of them had been hanging on by a thread anyway, and now that Buenos Aires was making it perfectly clear that they planned to try to run everything their own way, revolt erupted everywhere, joining together with the old Federal League and sparking a full-blown civil war. Pueyrredón himself was booted as Supreme Dictator.",
            "The new Supreme Dictator then demanded San Martín’s Army of the Andes abandon their plan to invade Peru and return to Argentina to defend the government, and San Martín refused. So the government in Buenos Aires was finally defeated by the combined army of federalists, who then joined to force them to submit to a decentralized government in February of 1820. Once all of this reached San Martín, he took a momentous step. He gathered his army in Santiago in July of 1820 and said, ",
            "“The government under which we were formed is no more. We do not answer to anyone anymore. Today, we answer only to ourselves.” ",
            "The men were all for this. They didn’t want to go back and fight in a civil war in Argentina, and they exuberantly ratified San Martín’s declaration and voted him Commander-in-Chief of an army that now fought for no one but themselves and answered to no civilian authority. ",
            "Back in Buenos Aires, San Martín’s reputation took a beating, as he was accused of stealing an army. But all they could do was vent and howl. San Martín would not be coming home. He was going to Peru. ",
            "So next week, as I said, we’re going to double back a bit and introduce yet another very colorful character from the very, very colorful world of Latin American independence: the Sea Wolf, Thomas Cochrane. After a brilliant naval career during the Napoleonic Wars, during which he routinely ran afoul of his superiors, his subordinates, and public opinion— that is, when he wasn’t being justly celebrated as one of the great heroes of the war — Cochrane would eventually seek his fortunes in South America, and he allowed himself to be recruited to lead the liberating navy San Martín was constructing in Chile. And next week, they will all join forces to invade and liberate the last loyal Spanish viceroyalty left in South America."

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So last week, we brought José de San Martín, Bernardo O’Higgins, and all their friends through the Andes, where after a couple of years of fighting the Spanish and arguing amongst themselves, they all liberated Chile. Now, as we’ll see today, there were still a few Spanish strongholds left in the country. But with the benefit of hindsight, we do know that Chile was never going to be reconquered. And with the patriots now in control of Chile for good, José de San Martín was able to go back to his planned invasion of Peru. And after liberating himself from the government of Buenos Aires in July of 1820, he could now pursue the final boss without distraction. ",
            "San Martín’s plan was to use the small but growing Chilean navy that was anchored in Valparaíso to ferry his army up to Peru and then converge on the capital of Lima from all sides, landing armies that would besiege the capital by land, while using the navy to blockade it by sea. Now, it was a fairly audacious plan, given that at the moment, San Martín’s army was not more than 5,000 men, while the Spanish still had just shy of 25,000 men spread out across the territories they still controlled in Peru and Upper Peru. But that 25,000 was dispersed all over the place. And San Martín was betting that if he could be bolstered by Peruvian recruits, the liberating forces would always be able to at least match, man for man, any Spanish garrison in any given area. ",
            "The naval side of the invasion, however, was still a little dicey. By July of 1820, that is, when San Martín declared his army a free agent, he had at his disposal eight warships and 16 troop transports run by about 1,600 sailors, a mix of Chilean locals and British and North American mercenaries. Now, it was absolutely critical for this fleet to not only successfully ferry the army up the coast but also to maintain the blockade of Lima. As long as Lima could be supplied and reinforced by sea, it could hold out indefinitely. So neutralizing the Spanish navy and controlling the Pacific coast was the key to San Martín’s plan. ",
            "Luckily, the man now leading that little navy was the flamboyant and enormously capable Scottish captain, Lord Thomas Cochrane. And though Cochrane and San Martín would come to hate each other’s guts for a variety of reasons, both good and bad, Cochrane would turn out to be the man who made sure that the key to San Martín’s plan was properly turned and the great Viceroyalty of Peru was finally unlocked. And because Cochrane is so important to this phase of Spanish American independence and lived quite a life both before and after his adventures in Chile, the best way to explain the liberation of Peru is through the eyes of the Seawolf. ",
            "Lord Thomas Cochrane was born on December 14, 1775, into an eccentric family of Scottish nobles. His grandfather, Thomas Cochrane, the 8th Earl of Dundonald, was a career army officer and occasional MP who sired a dozen children, including eight sons who lived to adulthood— a cohort of brothers who would all enter into various aspects of military and political life. Some of whom would wind up respectable, some not so much, and some, like our man Thomas, a bit of both. Of this horde of Cochranes who all came of age at around the same time, the Earl of St. Vincent, who, as First Lord of the Admiralty, had had cause to deal with most of the Cochranes at one point or another, said “the Cochranes are not to be trusted out of sight. They are all mad, romantic, money-getting and not truth-telling, and there is not a single exception in any part of the family”. Now, this is hyperbole, but not by much. ",
            "Thomas’s father, Archibald, was the eldest of all these mad, romantic, money-getting, not truth-telling brothers. And so, when the old patriarch of the clan died in 1778, Archibald inherited the family estate and became the 9th Earl of Dundonald. An exceedingly clever chap, Archibald was an inventor by disposition, and though he was pretty brilliant and did innovative work using coal tar to protect ship hulls and developing uses for soda, his work never paid off financially. And by the time Thomas was a teenager, the family fortune was pretty well spent and its estates were being sold off. So despite being the eldest son, Thomas had to go off like he was the younger son of nobility, and his father pushed him to join the army when he was 13. But Thomas hated army life and begged to join the Navy instead. Finally, his father relented, and in 1793, at the age of 17, he was enrolled as a midshipman in the Royal Navy, which, as you’ll notice, was just in time for him to get in on the beginning of the wars of the French Revolution. ",
            "Thomas was promoted to lieutenant in 1796 and mostly spent his time blockading Cádiz after the French whipped the Spanish and forced them to switch sides in 1795. The young officer was sharp and brave, but he also did not suffer fools gladly, even when, or maybe especially when, they were his superior officers. And in 1800, he escaped a court martial with a mere reprimand after being accused of insolence to a superior officer. But one of Thomas’s uncles, Alexander Cochrane, was on the respectable side of the family and had himself become an Admiral by that point, and so he kept his nephew’s naval career on track. And before we move on, I should mention that this uncle, Admiral Alexander Cochrane, just so happened to be the Governor of Barbados when Francisco de Miranda and the Leander Expedition came through in 1806. Admiral Cochrane offered support and a place of refuge for Miranda before and after the failed invasion. And it was Alexander Cochrane’s letters back to the Ministry that led the British to take Miranda back into their employ after he returned to London in semi-disgrace.",
            "So, after dodging the court martial, young Thomas Cochrane got his first command and from the beginning, showed off his daring and knack for cunning deception that would define his career. He escaped a Spanish patrol boat by pretending to be a Dutch neutral merchant ship under quarantine. He captured a Spanish warship and all 263 sailors on board with just 48 men, after tricking the Spanish into thinking reinforcements were on the way. He took down some anchored French privateers by attacking in boats with all his men, leaving only a skeleton crew on board his own ship. And that skeleton crew used a complicated system of ropes and pulleys devised by Cochrane to make it look like the warship was fully operational, when in fact, there weren’t even enough men left on board to fire the guns. A few months later, Cochrane then successfully destroyed an entire French merchant fleet by sneaking his men up into the fort that was supposed to be protecting them as they sat anchored in the harbor and then blasting them out of the water with the French army’s own guns. After being briefed on the exploits of Lord Cochrane, the Emperor Napoleon himself dubbed Cochrane the Seawolf. ",
            "The British public ate all of this up, and Cochrane decided to parlay his fame into a political career. The Cochrane clan was always coming in and out of Parliament, and Thomas decided to get in on the action. After losing an election in early 1806, after refusing to buy votes, Cochrane didn’t make the same mistake twice, and in the spring of 1807, he was elected MP from Westminster. A reform-minded liberal, one of Cochrane’s abiding passions was rooting out corruption in the Admiralty, which did not sit well with his superiors at all. So shortly after he took his seat, they ordered him to sail at once for the Mediterranean coast, where he could kill Frenchmen and not make any more trouble for them. ",
            "There he again performed splendidly, raiding the coastline as the French began their invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. And in late 1807, Cochrane famously held Fort Trinidad and delayed the passage of a 6,000-man French army for two weeks with just 80 men. When he finally had to give it up, he rigged the fort with explosives and blew it up so that the French couldn’t use it. ",
            "But Cochrane ran into major problems in 1809, when the irresistible force of his talent ran into the immovable wall that was the Admiralty. A small French fleet of eleven ships had escaped the British blockade at Brest and was now raiding around the Bay of Biscay, finally tracked down to a small channel near the so-called Basque Roads, sea lanes south of La Rochelle. And the French now occupied a strong anchorage in a channel between two islands, and they could only be rooted out with extreme measures. And Lord Cochrane believed he had such measures in hand. He presented to his superiors improved plans for fire ships and exploding vessels of his own design. After spending a few weeks preparing everything, Lord Cochrane personally led the first wave, and he sent off the three exploding vessels that were packed tight with gunpowder and mortars and grenades. These ships did the work of blowing up the boom that the French had erected across the channel to prevent any ships from entering. Now, this was supposed to be followed by a bombardment of 22 fire ships. A fire ship is just an empty ship that gets set on fire. But the fire ships were cut loose a mile away from the channel, and only four actually hit their target. But still, the French fleet panicked at the sight of this wave of fire coming at them and purposefully ran their ships aground so the crews could escape this apparent explosive onslaught. ",
            "Cochrane saw all these beached and vulnerable ships and signaled for the Admiral running the operation to please attack now. But despite receiving the signal, the Admiral didn’t get moving for a good 6 hours, allowing the tide to come in and refloat the French fleet. Now Cochrane finally forced the Admiral to send some ships to attack by pretending that his own ship was damaged and adrift and that he desperately needed help. This detachment was, in the end, able to take out four of the eleven French ships, but the rest got away, and Cochrane was furious at the Admiral for the missed opportunity. ",
            "He was then doubly furious when he got back to London and discovered that the Admiral was going to get a citation for this victory of the Battle of the Basque Roads, while Cochrane himself was barely getting a notice. He made no secret of his feelings, and the press, who already loved him, trumpeted Cochrane’s version of events. The besmirched Admiral demanded a court martial to clear his name. But because a court martial is just a bunch of his buddies sitting around in a room, the Admiral was exonerated even in the face of clear evidence that he was, in fact, full of it. So, though, the truth and the press were on his side, Lord Cochrane’s name was now mud in the Admiralty, and his naval career seemed over. ",
            "Again, Napoleon was later briefed on all of this, and he laughed. He said “both the French and British admirals were imbeciles, and thank God nobody did what Cochrane said or my whole fleet would have been lost.” Instead, Cochrane was stripped of his command and he pivoted over to civilian politics. ",
            "Still a member of Parliament, Cochrane was part of an emerging group of liberal radicals in the House of Commons who made trouble for the conservative powers running the war by highlighting corruption, sloth, and incompetence wherever they could find it. In 1810, Cochrane got caught up defending his friend and fellow radical MP, Sir Francis Burdett, who had offended the honor of the House with some intemperate insult and was now in danger of being thrown in the Tower of London. With agents on the way to pick his friend up, Cochrane rigged Burdett’s house with explosives and seemed sincere about his willingness to blow the whole place up rather than let Burdett be taken alive. When Burdett realized his friend was serious, he defused, almost literally defused the situation and was taken into custody and temporarily tossed into the Tower. ",
            "Now a confirmed gadfly and pariah in polite society, Cochrane then fell in love with a 16-year-old common girl named Kitty, whom he then proceeded to marry for no other reason than love. His uncle Basil, the richest now of the Cochrane brothers, disinherited his nephew over the marriage, cutting Thomas off from really any promise of a comfortable life. His failing fortunes are what made the real scandal of his career so believable, even to those who liked him and wanted to believe the best of him. So, just as we talked about Gregor McGregor and the Poyais scheme as one of the most audacious scams in economic history, we’re going to talk about how Lord Thomas Cochrane was implicated in one of the first great stock market frauds. Indeed, it is called the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814. ",
            "On the morning of February 21st, 1814, a man claiming to be the personal aide to the British Ambassador to Russia disembarked in Dover with extraordinary news. The French Imperial Army had been decisively routed in eastern France and the Emperor Napoleon had been killed in the fighting. This message was then confirmed and relayed up the post roads to London by three French royalist officers, spreading the good news that the Bourbons had reclaimed the French throne. This stunning news spread like wildfire through London, and when it hit the city, the London Stock Exchange went nuts. Any government-backed security shot through the roof as men sought to get in on the financial stability that was sure to follow this great victory. ",
            "But now you’re already saying to yourself, what on earth are you talking about? Napoleon didn’t die in eastern France in early 1814. I mean, Waterloo isn’t even for another 16 months. None of this is true, is it? And no, it was not. By the afternoon, the government had issued a stern rebuttal of the rumor and the victory bubble burst as quickly as it had formed. ",
            "It did not take long for the authorities running the London Stock Exchange to suspect deliberate fraud had taken place. And combing back through the records of the biggest winners of the brief bubble, they came across the name Andrew Cochrane Johnston, the youngest of the mad, romantic, money-getting and not truth-telling Cochrane brothers. The record showed that Andrew had purchased shares in a government stock on margin just one week earlier and then sold them at the very height of the bubble, clearing over a million pounds profit. Further investigation then unraveled everything and connections were made between Andrew, his stockbroker, Richard Butt, and the man who said he was the aide to the Russian ambassador, who turned out to be a down-on-his-luck mercenary, just playing the part he had been assigned. Then this little circle was connected to our man, Lord Thomas Cochrane, because it turns out that Thomas had dined with his uncle and Mr. Butt on the morning the fraud had begun and been among those who profited in the swindle. The fake ambassador’s aide then also claimed that Lord Thomas had given him money to make his getaway. Now, Cochrane claimed he had no knowledge of anything. He didn’t deny the breakfast, and he didn’t deny that he had met this down-on-his-luck mercenary. But he said, “Look, I didn’t know what they were up to. I only made 1% on the deal. And that was only because I had an automatic sell order with Mr. Butt. So far from profiting, I actually missed out on the whole thing.” But the circumstantial evidence piled up way too high for any juror to really believe that Lord Cochrane’s protests of ignorance and innocence were legitimate. ",
            "The whole crew was indicted in late April 1814, and by June, the trial was wrapping up. Cochrane’s disreputable uncle Andrew, the man clearly at the center of this scheme, managed to escape to France before the verdict was handed down. But Lord Thomas Cochrane, great naval hero and MP, was not so lucky. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment in King’s Bench State House and ordered to pay a £1,000 fine. His name was then removed from the Navy’s pension list, and he was booted from Parliament, though his defiant and well-paid supporters went ahead and reelected him in the next election anyway, even though he was sitting in prison. ",
            "Now, Cochrane was not exactly ruined by all this. The whole affair only deepened his popularity in the small but vocal radical circles, who now considered him a martyr, prosecuted by the malicious conservative enemies they all shared. He served his sentence, paid his fine, and was released shortly after the real news came correctly this time, that Napoleon had been defeated at Waterloo. So, despite the stock market scandal, Cochrane was still an MP, and he spent the next three years as a radical member of Parliament, railing against the conservative post-war governments and joining in the movement for parliamentary reform to get rid of the kind of rotten boroughs that had actually elected Cochrane in the first place and backing universal manhood suffrage. But by 1818, he was pretty well down on his luck. He had been cut off from his naval pension and, despite constant badgering, was never given his full share of prize money from his success out on the high seas. Now approaching insolvency, his house was seized for failure to repay debts, and it really did seem like there was no hope for him to ever recover his career or his fortune. ",
            "Enter the Chilean ambassador to Great Britain, José Alvarez, who had a job offer he wanted to discuss with Lord Cochrane. ",
            "For the patriot South Americans, Lord Cochrane’s misfortune was a huge opportunity to procure the services of a man who, if nothing else, was a uniformly brilliant naval officer. Alvarez offered Cochrane command of the navy that José de San Martín was putting together for his invasion of Peru. And after extravagant promises of the profits to be made, Cochrane agreed to join the fleet, and he turned his back on Great Britain. ",
            "In August of 1818, Lord Cochrane, his wife Kitty, and their two young sons boarded a ship and sailed for Chile. While en route, Lord Cochrane, without any apparent patriotic hangups, tried to convince his new bosses to swing by St. Helena and rescue Napoleon from exile, then bring the great man to South America and install him as, like, Emperor of the liberated continent. The Chileans apparently listened politely to all this and said, “Yes, well, we’ve already gotten word that the viceroy in Peru has landed an invasion force back home, so maybe we should just keep moving, okay?”",
            "Now, by the time the ship docked in Valparaiso in November 1818, that invasion force had long since been destroyed by San Martín at the Battle of Maipu, which we talked about last week. And for Cochrane, at least, the situation really was as it had been described to him back in London — a rare occurrence for British officers recruited to serve in South America. General San Martín and Supreme Dictator O’Higgins had by now acquired a small fleet of seven warships, some of them purchased in England, some in the United States, and a few others captured on the high seas, including what became Cochrane’s flagship, a 48-gun frigate, rechristened The O’Higgins. As the new vice admiral, Cochrane’s job was to get the fleet into real fighting shape and hopefully make some effective cruises up and down the coast to clear space for the invasion of Peru. ",
            "The bulk of the Spanish fleet, 14 warships in all, was stationed in Lima’s heavily fortified port of Callao. Neutralizing that fleet and blockading Callao was Cochrane’s overriding mission, and in January 1819, he sailed out on his first voyage as Admiral of the Chilean Navy. He dropped most of his ships outside Callao so they could begin a blockade of shipping into Lima, while he himself conducted raids up and down the Pacific coast. Well-versed in sea raiding from his days in the Napoleonic Wars, Cochrane found the coast of Peru easy pickings, as most of the natives had never had to deal with anything more than the odd pirate. But the chain of command in the Chilean Navy was still a work in progress, and the man Cochrane had left in charge of the blockade — and the man he had replaced as commander of the Chilean Navy, by the way — claimed that he was short of supplies and inexplicably sailed back to Valparaiso in June of 1819. ",
            "So, returning to Valparaiso, and reasserting his authority, and regrouping the fleet, Cochrane promised to break Callao by the end of September, and he sailed back up the coast. Always the explosives expert, Cochrane hoped to use a new type of rocket he devised to bombard the main fortress of the port, but they did not work as well in practice as they did in theory, and Cochrane was forced to break off the attack without doing any real damage at all. ",
            "So then, on his own initiative, he abandoned his attempt to capture Callao and instead decided to try his luck further south. Now, though the Battle of Maipu had saved Chilean independence, that did not mean that the royalists were gone for good. And down south of Concepción, there was a particularly hard iron nut that they could never crack — the fortresses of Valdivia. ",
            "Ironically built by Bernardo’s father, Ambrosio O’Higgins, when he was Captain General of Chile, the heavily fortified mouth of the Valdivia River was called the Gibraltar of Chile and would forever remain an entry port for the Spanish if they decided to come back. Lord Cochrane got it in his head that he wanted to go take it. ",
            "Cochrane combined every trick he knew to take Valdivia, which was defended by a string of seven different forts plus an island castle, collectively manned by 1,600 Spanish soldiers and 118 cannons. In all of the wars of Chilean independence, the patriots had never come close to seizing Valdivia. But in December 1819, Cochrane picked up intelligence that the forts were expecting three Spanish ships any day now. And so he sailed down with three ships of his own, hoisted the Spanish flag, and waited for a pilot to come out from shore to navigate him through the treacherous harbor. This guy was, of course, seized. And then Cochrane sailed away, much to the bewilderment of the Spanish soldiers manning the fort, who still thought the vessels were their comrades, and that them picking up and leaving was very peculiar behavior. ",
            "Cochrane then sailed back up to Concepcion, picked up 250 soldiers, and came back down to Valdivia in late January 1820. But as he was making preparations to attack, his ship, The O’Higgins, accidentally ran into a reef, and though it was patched together, was crippled and taking on water. So Cochrane transferred his 250 men to two smaller ships, and then, using the intelligence they had pumped from the captured pilot, they flew the Spanish flag and sailed on into the harbor, just as confident as you please. And it wasn’t until they were practically landing that the soldiers in the forts put together that these were not, in fact, their comrades. ",
            "Landing now under heavy fire, the little Chilean force took cover until night fell, and then they launched what became something of a stampede attack on the string of forts. They attacked the fort closest to their position, overtaking it and sending the defenders racing for the next fort in line. But the Chileans were so close on the heels of these running Spaniards that they were able to fight their way into the second fort too. So pretty soon, the defenders of the first two forts were all running together for the third fort, and chaos was reigning. It went on like this all night, and by morning, the entire west side of the harbor had been captured by the Chileans, and the main castle was forced to surrender under threat of bombardment. ",
            "With only one fort left, Cochrane then ordered The O’Higgins to come barreling into the harbor, which scared the last of the Spanish soldiers, who did not realize the ship was running on a skeleton crew, was crippled, probably did not have enough men to run the guns, and, frankly, might sink at any moment. But the appearance of The O’Higgins broke Spanish morale, and the remaining garrisons all fled up the Valdivia River towards the city of Valdivia proper. Two days later, Cochrane’s men followed them, and rather than fight it out, what was left of the Spanish garrisons evacuated into the deep interior. At the cost of just seven dead, Lord Cochrane had taken the supposedly impregnable Gibraltar of Chile. ",
            "With this victory in hand, Cochrane was now a bona fide war hero, and at this point, he also apparently followed up on his stymied little dream of freeing Napoleon and bringing the great French General to rule the continent. He ordered a fast ship to sail back around Cape Horn and make for St. Helena, but by the time the ship arrived a few months later, the exiled emperor was clearly on his last legs and would, in fact, die less than a year later. So despite Cochrane’s dream, there would be no final chapter for Napoleon in South America. It would make for a good alternative history, though, if you’re into that sort of thing. ",
            "So this all gets us back to where we left off last time in July of 1820. San Martín had declared his own personal independence from Buenos Aires, and final preparations for the invasion of Peru were now wrapping up. And on August 21, the great Liberating Fleet set sail. Now with eight warships and 16 troop transports manned by 1,600 sailors, Cochrane’s navy ferried San Martín and 4,100 men north, landing first at the Peruvian city of Pisco, 150 miles south of Lima on September 7. ",
            "San Martín disembarked his forces and hoped to raise more recruits from liberated slaves in the region, but the owners had been tipped off that he was coming, so they moved everybody inland, and the patriots were only able to raise about 600 new black soldiers. Ever careful, though, San Martín stayed in Pisco for a good six weeks, sending about 3,000 men on a great sweeping march in through the interior to clear out local Spanish forces, raise more men, and then converge on Lima. But the sitting around and doing nothing started to rub Cochrane the wrong way, he was chomping at the bit, and he started making reckless accusations that General San Martín was, in fact, a coward who was afraid of actual combat. And San Martín got understandably sick of Cochrane’s impatient carping. He had a plan. It was going to work; just relax.",
            "But unwilling to sit idly by, Cochrane went a little rogue. He led a few ships back up to Callao, ostensibly on a reconnaissance mission, but really, Lord Cochrane was just looking for some action. Spying the Spanish flagship, the 44-gun Esmeralda, anchored in the harbor, Cochrane decided to seize her. ",
            "Orchestrating a daring night raid by boat, on the night of November 5, Cochrane and his men took the crew of the Esmeralda completely by surprise. The Spanish sailors offered stiff resistance, and Cochrane himself was wounded in multiple places. But after less than 20 minutes of fighting, Cochrane and his boys took the Esmeralda. ",
            "The shore batteries were then alerted that the ship had been seized by the enemy and started firing their guns into the darkness, at which point, any neutral merchant ship in the harbor quickly raised their prearranged light to signal their neutrality and sailed away from the fray to avoid the bombardment. Cochrane’s men simply raised lights of their own to match the neutral signal and sailed away with them. ",
            "The capture of the Esmeralda turned out to be a major turning point. The Spanish fleet was now well and truly cooped up in Callao and could not hope to break out without risking total annihilation. Meanwhile, the whole rest of the Pacific coast, practically as far north as Mexico, was now dominated by Cochrane’s Chilean Navy. And in fact, it was a direct result of these naval victories that the port of Guayaquil revolted in January of 1821, just a few months later. This was the revolt that led Bolívar to peel off Sucre to go capture the city before San Martín could claim it for himself. ",
            "Controlling the sea had always been the key to victory in Peru, and though Cochrane and San Martín clashed personally and clashed over strategy — and really clashed over everything — Cochrane kept up his end of the bargain and handed San Martín the key to victory. ",
            "After the patriots landed a second liberating force north of Lima, the slow strangulation of the capital began. With their forces now taking control of the interior roads in and out of the city and the navy cutting off all hope of resupply and reinforcement, the population of Lima started to get nervous, and then they started to get desperate. ",
            "In February 1821, the old viceroy was overthrown by a more liberal Spanish General, though this was not at all in preparation for surrender, but rather to offer stiffer and hopefully more united resistance. While the situation inside Lima grew more desperate by the day, Lord Cochrane kept urging San Martín to attack, and San Martín kept refusing. Instead, he smuggled Patriot propaganda into Lima and let it be known that he might start letting food in to relieve their suffering. “You know, none of you are my enemies. Not even the Spanish garrison is my enemy, and they will never be my enemy so long as they do not meet me on the field of battle.” ",
            "San Martín was not a coward, but he did want to take Lima without firing a shot, and it drove Lord Cochrane nuts. ",
            "But events kept working in San Martín’s favor. In early July 1821, the new General in charge of the Spanish garrison announced his intention to pull all of his forces out of Lima and hole up in fortified Callao, leaving the capital itself wide open to attack. Terrified that a horde of blacks and Indians were about to come murder them all in their beds, the residents of Lima begged General San Martín to please enter the city and defend us. And so, on July 9, 1821, José de San Martín entered Lima. But as he had done in Chile, San Martín made it clear that he had come to liberate the Peruvians, not to rule them. Nine days later, he orchestrated the formal declaration of Peruvian independence.",
            "But the liberation of Lima did not mean the liberation of Peru, and up in the mountainous interior, Spanish forces were regrouping to hold their last precious possessions in South America. And San Martín’s lack of adequate resources and his soon-to-be failing political reputation would come to hinder his ability to bring about the full liberation of Peru, leading his occasional correspondence with Simón Bolívar, his fellow liberator to the north, to turn into a more practical correspondence about how to join forces and enter the endgame of Spanish American independence. ",
            "So, we’ll move back up to deal with Bolívar and that part of the story next time. But before we go this week, we have to wrap up with Lord Cochrane. ",
            "Now, through his two-and-a-half-year service to Chile, Cochrane and San Martín had clashed repeatedly. While just days after the declaration of Peruvian independence, the two finally blew up at each other. As we’ll see next time, the now essentially stateless San Martín was ready to leave Chile behind and focus on Peru and to that end, he started talking about his desire to buy the Chilean Navy from O’Higgins and recommission it for the Patriot Peruvians. Cochrane was 100% opposed to the idea and thought the whole scheme reeked of treachery and betrayal. All the more so when Cochrane started demanding to settle all accounts for him and his men now that the war was supposedly over and San Martín seemed to be deliberately stalling. ",
            "On August 4, 1821, the two got into the argument to end all arguments. Cochrane accused San Martín of being a drug-addled coward, and San Martín accused Cochrane of being a hotheaded mercenary. Cochrane then stormed off, boarded his ship, and, after taking the temperature of his men, led them north to track down a treasure ship that had been dispatched by San Martín to help pay for operations in the north. Cochrane overtook the ship, seized it and its treasure, and dispersed it among his grateful sailors. He then kept sailing, looking for any other lingering prizes he might catch, making it as far north as Acapulco by January 1822, before turning around and heading back to Chile. When he arrived in Valparaíso, he was greeted as a hero — doubly so because it was clear that he had defended Chile’s honor and sovereignty against San Martín’s manipulations. Cochrane warned Supreme Director O’Higgins that San Martín could not be trusted. But by then, O’Higgins had come to rely on a secretary who really did not like Lord Cochrane at all. And so, despite his heroic service, Lord Cochrane was becoming persona non grata. ",
            "Now, Cochrane’s adventurous life was not over, though; this was just the end of one chapter. At the end of 1822, he was contacted by agents from Brazil in much the same way he had once been contacted by agents from Chile. A civil war had broken out among patriot Brazilians who refused to be resubordinated to European domination, and they had launched a war of independence. Cochrane agreed to take over their navy just as he had taken over the Chilean Navy. And so, in January of 1823, he sailed back around Cape Horn, never to return.",
            "But his time in Brazil went much like his time had gone everywhere. He was successful in war, but squabbles over honor and prize money led him to depart Brazil at the end of 1825 under a cloud of mutual recriminations. He then went off and joined the Greek Navy, who were fighting for independence from the Ottoman Empire, and he fought well in that war until it came to an end in 1829. So that’s three wars of independence in a row for him. ",
            "Cochrane then returned to Britain, somewhat rehabilitated. He was re-enrolled in the Royal Navy and got his pension back. He then started getting promoted back up the ladder, eventually becoming an Admiral. When his father died in 1831, he also became the 10th Earl of Dundonald. After a series of promotions took him all the way to the top of the Admiralty, he finally died of an operation to cure a kidney stone in 1860.",
            "But we are now far removed from our story. We have to get back to Peru, which we will do next time, and finally bring about the face-to-face meeting between José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar in liberated Guayaquil in 1822. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "We have strayed a bit from Bolívar in the past few episodes, abandoning him after the victory at Carabobo so we could go down and snag José de San Martín and bring him up to Lima. So when last we left our intrepid Liberator, it was October of 1821, and he had just accepted the presidency of the new Republic of Colombia. But if you will recall, though he didn’t really want the job, and he left day-to-day administration of Colombia to Vice President Santander, who really did want the job. ",
            "As much as Bolívar avoided civilian politics to keep his focus on military affairs, Santander embraced civilian politics and was happy to never have to fire a shot in anger ever again. The Liberator and the man of laws were, in that respect, the perfect team: Bolívar running the army, Santander running the government. But their diverging responsibilities would soon lead to friction between the two men. Bolívar would grow impatient with Santander’s obsession with legal formalities, while Santander would get exasperated with Bolívar’s imperious demands.",
            "As soon as the two men formally took up their offices in October 1821, this friction began to reveal itself. Bolívar ordered Santander to dig up 5,000 men and appropriate arms and supplies and have them ready to march south out of Bogotá as soon as possible. Now, Santander did his best to accommodate the liberator, but this was the beginning of a long-running feud between them, with Bolívar constantly demanding more Colombian men, more Colombian arms, and more Colombian money, even as he himself marched further and further away from Colombia. But for the moment, Bolívar’s objective was still to make Colombia whole, to go evict the last remaining royalists from Colombian-claimed territory in some heroic battle, finding that “Third Sister” to join Boyacá and Carabobo to mark the liberation of Quito. So Santander supplied Bolívar with an army.",
            "So, to set the stage here, remember from our last few episodes that after Lord Cochrane’s naval victory secured the high seas for the patriots in 1820, the critical port city of Guayaquil declared independence at the end of the year. As soon as he heard the news, Bolívar dispatched 1,000 Colombian troops under Brigadier General Sucre to ensure that Guayaquil remained free from Spanish rule, but more importantly, that it was eventually integrated into Gran Colombia. So, as Bolívar gathered his troops in Bogotá at the end of 1821 to march off and liberate Quito, his plan was to lead his army to the coast, ferry them all down to Guayaquil by sea, link up with Sucre, and then together they would all push up into the mountains together to capture Quito. And by early December, Bolívar had gathered about 4,000 men — not the 5,000 he had asked for, but it was deemed good enough — and on December 13, 1821, Bolívar marched out of Bogotá. ",
            "But his grand plan was thwarted by some bad intelligence. A report came up from the coast that Spanish ships were landing more troops and controlled the entire coastline. But this was not true at all. Somebody just saw a single ship landing a small party of about 800 reinforcements and then wildly exaggerated what was going on. The false intelligence forced Bolívar to alter his plans. Abandoning the sea route, he would now march the rough mountain road southwest all the way to Quito, while sending orders down to Sucre in Guayaquil to come up and hit them from the other side. The only problem, though, was that royalist forces had pretty well bottled Sucre up in Guayaquil, and he couldn’t get out. And given the communication lag time between the two forces, neither Sucre nor Bolívar really knew what the other was doing. And it was more by luck than anything else that they managed the two-front offensive on Quito. ",
            "The change in plans meant yet another feat of patriotic endurance, as the long march through the mountainous roads to Quito took months and took its toll. It cost Bolívar men to death, injury, and desertion practically every day. But after slogging unhappily along for a few weeks, Bolívar finally got some good news. Approaching Popayán, the first major royalist-held city on the road to Quito, Bolívar was delighted to be presented with a note from the commander of the city’s garrison. Not only was he ready to surrender, but he was willing to defect. So this was great news. Not only did Bolívar not have to fight to secure Popayán, but he got a whole bunch more troops to boot. ",
            "Suspecting that this was evidence of collapsing royalist morale, and that this collapse of morale might be exploitable, Bolívar hatched what he thought was a pretty clever plan. As he marched towards Pasto, the next major city on the road to Quito, he wrote back to Vice President Santander, requesting that he compose fake news articles reporting that the Spanish were giving up hope on holding South America, and then plant them in Bogotá newspapers. Bolívar also requested fake official communiqués that would show the Spanish requesting safe passage for negotiators, and warm letters of greeting from both Vice President Santander and General Páez back in Venezuela. Now, given the recent liberal revolution back in Spain, the idea that the Spanish might have dispatched envoys to negotiate surrender was not at all implausible. And so, when Bolívar reached the gates of Pasto, he had this stack of evidence supporting this fake story. ",
            "But unfortunately, he found the royalists in Pasto far more hostile to the republic and not buying this propaganda for a second. Maybe it was true, maybe it wasn’t, but they were not going to believe it until they heard it straight from the lion’s mouth. So his ruse failed, Bolívar tried to keep marching rather than get bogged down besieging Pasto, but as he moved, 1,200 royalists from the Pasto garrison marched out to block his path. In rough volcanic country, riddled with steep cliffs, the two armies ran into each other at Bomboná in late April, where the royalists successfully took strategic high ground and waited for Bolívar to try to march through. Giving himself back to his old instincts, Bolívar decided that he could take the outnumbered royalists on Easter Sunday, 1822, and he ordered his men on a full frontal assault up the steep cliffs to try to capture the high ground the royalists held. The results were predictably gruesome, as Bolívar’s forces took heavy casualties. But one intrepid patriot officer led a unit on a daring climb up a sheer cliff face to get the drop on the royalists. But even with this success, the fighting went on until night fell, and under the cover of both darkness and fog, the Pasto royalists elected to withdraw from their position rather than keep fighting. So technically, the Battle of Bomboná was a victory for Bolívar, but it was a pyrrhic one, to be sure, costing him 600 dead and wounded, to say nothing of the desertions that followed in the immediate aftermath. ",
            "So, despite claiming it as a victory, the Battle of Bomboná was obviously not the third sister Bolívar was hunting for. And in fact, much to his later chagrin, it would turn out that he would not be the one to find that elusive third sister. And in fact, in the story of the liberation of Quito, the role of the Liberator was to act as mere distraction — a distraction that allowed Antonio José Sucre to break out of Guayaquil and attack Quito from the other direction. And since it would be Sucre and not Bolívar who would find the third sister on the slopes of the Pichincha volcano, let’s now finally bring Sucre onto the board. ",
            "Antonio José de Sucre was born in the eastern Venezuelan city of Cumaná in 1795. Descended from old Flemish nobility that had come over to Spanish America a century earlier, Sucre’s grandfather had served as governor of both Cuba and Caracas, and Sucre’s father was the governor of Cumaná province at the time of his birth. So though little Antonio was not Caracas aristocracy, he was born and raised in Cumaná, and he was still the son of the elite criollo ruling class. ",
            "As would have been standard for a boy of his position, he was enrolled in a military cadet academy as a young teenager, but this was right as the world was being turned upside down. I mean, Sucre was only twelve when the abdication of Bayonne hit. So young Sucre remained enrolled in the army through the next few turbulent years, as the Caracas junta took over in 1810 and then as Venezuela declared independence in 1811. Stationed in the east as a junior officer, though, Sucre does not appear to have seen much military service during the campaigns that had been led by Francisco de Miranda. And after the fall of the First Republic in 1812, Sucre appears to have just been amnestied by the victorious Monteverde.",
            "Now, from here, I lose track of him a little bit because, though we know that Sucre got papers that would allow him to depart for British Trinidad, it’s not clear that he ever actually left. If he did go to Trinidad, that means he linked up with Santiago Mariño there and probably joined the 45 who came back over into Venezuela to restart the war. But more probably, Sucre stayed in eastern Venezuela and simply joined Mariño’s growing army when it arrived in early 1813. Whichever it was though, he joined Mariño’s army as it liberated the eastern provinces through 1813. This is as Bolívar was coming through on the Admirable Campaign, all of which culminated in the founding of the Second Republic. But after the founding of the Second Republic, Sucre’s life took a tragic turn. As we saw in Episode 5.11, when the Legions of Hell pushed the republicans east, Sucre’s homeland became a bloody war zone, as the War to the Death was still in full swing. No one was spared — not civilian, not soldier. And most of Sucre’s brothers and sisters and extended family were killed through the bloody year of 1814, as the Second Republic collapsed. Sucre himself only survived because he followed General Bermúdez to the relative safety of Margarita Island. But that turned out to only be a temporary safe haven because Pablo Morillo’s Grand Armada came roaring over the horizon in April 1815, and the last Venezuelan republican holdouts on Margarita Island were forced to flee to Cartagena. ",
            "This means that Sucre was present for Pablo Morillo’s subsequent siege of Cartagena, and along with Bermúdez and the wily Scottish General Gregor McGregor, Sucre was among those who staged the final breakout from Cartagena in December 1815, and was among the patriot refugees who then sailed for the Republic of Haiti. ",
            "In Haiti, Sucre reunited with Mariño and was promoted to colonel, becoming Mariño’s Chief of Staff. But this was also the first time Sucre encountered Bolívar, at least in close quarters. And though I do not know what they made of each other at first glance, by now Sucre had developed loyalties to a greater revolutionary cause that extended beyond the scope of caudillo-style local power, pursued by his longtime superior Mariño. They all then sailed to Venezuela together, but as I mentioned in Episode 5.14, when Mariño started ignoring the orders of El Jefe Supremo Bolívar, Sucre was in the party of 30 officers who abandoned Mariño and rode off to join Bolívar, signaling that his attachment to the revolutionary cause was greater than his attachment to any particular man. ",
            "Made commander of the Lower Orinoco River, he was then elevated to General in 1819 by Vice President Zea, who was looking for men more committed to the greater revolutionary cause than any personal attachments. This was when Zea is trying and failing to exert authority over Mariño and Arismendi, and he promoted the supremely capable Sucre to general, even though he was still just 25 years old. ",
            "So, Sucre was not present for Bolívar’s march up into the Andes or the Battle of Boyacá, but he did meet Bolívar as the Liberator came rushing back to Angostura to deal with the coup that had been orchestrated by Mariño and Arismendi – this was all in Episode 5.17. Sucre had already earned Bolívar’s affection when he abandoned Mariño, but this is the point where it appears that he really started viewing Sucre as a potential heir apparent. Though young, Sucre showed wisdom beyond his years. His only fault really was a habit of micromanagement — he wanted to write every dispatch and review every supply shipment. But in the ragtag Venezuelan armies that often seemed slapped together with nothing more than bravado, a little micromanagement was not exactly a bad thing. So, Sucre attached himself to Bolívar and earned the Liberator’s trust to the point that Sucre was one of the principal go-betweens during the final negotiations with General Pablo Morillo in 1820. And so, he was there when they all got drunk and dropped the big rock down on the side of the road. And so when news subsequently came in January of 1821 that Guayaquil had revolted, there was no man Bolívar trusted more to head down to the city and defend it both from Spanish reconquest and, more importantly, to preserve it for future annexation into Colombia. There were very few men that Bolívar could trust out of sight, and Sucre proved to be the best of them. And Bolívar would later say that if God let you choose a family, he would have chosen Sucre as his son. ",
            "After finally arriving in Guayaquil in the spring of 1821, Sucre and his thousand troops proved to be a welcome addition to the cause. Mostly. The all-important port city was technically within the boundaries of the Viceroyalty of New Granada and had been for nearly a century, and was thus slated for future integration into Gran Colombia. But before that, they had been a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, and Guayaquil’s daily economic and social ties clearly faced south down the coast to Lima. Everyone passing through the harbor at Guayaquil was either going to or coming from Lima, so the population there was split about how they wanted to handle their independence. Most wanted to join themselves to Peru as soon as San Martín liberated it, while a few others did prefer Colombia, possibly suspecting that with their capital located in hard-to-reach Bogotá, rather than right down the coast in Lima, that their local autonomy might actually be enhanced. So, Sucre and his men were welcome. A thousand men is nothing to say no to, but the pro-Peruvian faction kept their eye on the young Colombian general. ",
            "Sucre made an initial attempt to start clearing out the road to Quito in the summer of 1821, but he ran into such heavy resistance that he was forced to fall back to the safety of Guayaquil. In fact, in Sucre’s estimation, without massive reinforcements, he was all but trapped in the city, and he wrote dispatches north to Bolívar and south to San Martín to tell both great Generals just that. ",
            "By this point, though, as San Martín had entered Lima and declared Peruvian independence, and after receiving Sucre’s request for reinforcements, he ordered 1,200 men to march north. Now, this was both a show of patriotic solidarity, but it also offered San Martín a chance to start staking his own claims to the region. With these men on the way, Sucre then marched out of Guayaquil again in January of 1822, taking a circuitous route to Quito. Rather than heading northeast straight at the capital, he instead headed due south, marching along the coast before turning and swinging up to the highland town of Saraguro. There he linked up with the 1,200 Peruvian reinforcements led by the highly capable young Colonel Andrés de Santa Cruz. ",
            "Now, Santa Cruz is a minor player in our story, but just so you know, he goes on to be President of liberated Bolivia from 1829 to 1839, in the middle of which he also became the Supreme Protector of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation from 1836 to 1839. That was during the War of the Confederation that was fought against Chile and Argentina. Because, FYI, it’s not like Spanish American independence is going to magically solve all the factional struggles in South America. ",
            "Anyway, Sucre and Santa Cruz prepared to march their combined army, now of about 3,000 men, through the mountains up to Quito from the deep south rather than coming up at them from the coast. As winter gave way to spring, Sucre and his army slowly advanced on Quito, forcing the all but nominal garrisons he encountered along the way to fall back at the first sight of this patriot army. And none of these garrisons could be reinforced because at the same time, Bolívar’s army was marching down from Colombia and was predictably soaking up a lot of royalist attention. ",
            "By late April 1822, Sucre had captured Riobamba and was making his final approach on Quito. The royalist leadership in the capital finally realized that Sucre posed a very real threat, and they heavily fortified the main roads leading into town. These fortifications were strong enough that Sucre determined a direct attack on the city would be suicidal. So rather than take the main roads, Sucre led his men up around through the treacherous volcanic peaks around the city to flank Quito’s defenses. It wasn’t until mid-May that the royalists realized Sucre was marching around them through the mountains. They tried to regroup, but with one final push up and over all 10,000 icy feet of the great volcano at Pichincha, Sucre’s army came pouring down out of the mountains on the morning of May 25, 1822. ",
            "Sucre’s army was met by a royalist defense force about 2,000 strong, and the two sides were instantly locked in an intense battle where neither side seemed to be able to get the upper hand. And they were both quite literally trying to get the upper hand, using the steep terrain to constantly take higher ground than the enemy currently held. Eventually, after hours of fighting, though, the royalist lines collapsed back towards Quito, just ahead of a formal order from their commanders to retreat. The patriot forces pursued these retreating royalists all the way to the gates of the city, but Sucre ordered his men not to enter the city. He didn’t want them charging in and plundering everything in sight because they were here to liberate Quito, not sack it. ",
            "The next day, Sucre demanded that the garrison commander of Quito surrender. And now, believing that it really was hopeless to hold out, the commander surrendered. And so Sucre was able to lead his men peacefully into Quito. A savvy and generous man of honor, Sucre went out of his way to keep his troops on a tight leash so that their arrival would be celebrated by the residents and not resented. He also followed through with the terms of surrender he had worked out. After placing the surviving royalist troops in custody, any Spanish soldier who wanted to depart the country was free to depart with full military honors. Although if anybody wanted to stay and defect to the patriot cause of liberty and justice, et cetera, et cetera, they were free to do so. Most of the soldiers elected to quit the country and go home, but more than a few walked across the lines.",
            "The fall of Quito was the great big domino the patriots hoped that it would be. The remaining royalists held cities in the region threw up their arms and said, “Forget it. We’re done.” As soon as they heard the capital had been taken, even the staunch holdouts in Pasto refused to just go down with the ship. And with Bolívar still lingering in the vicinity, they signaled their surrender. Now, as was usually the case with Bolívar, he was thrilled and dismayed by all this. Thrilled for all the obvious reasons, you know,  total victory and all that, but he was a little ticked off that his victory at Bomboná was going to be overshadowed by Sucre’s victory at Pichincha, that the glory for finding the third sister would go to Sucre and not Bolívar. And he wrote a few dispatches back to Santander trying to position the official story of the campaign as Bolívar being the victorious General. But to be fair to Bolívar, he would soon get over his disappointment. I mean, it was Sucre, after all, who won the battle, and if he was going to share the glory with any man, it was Sucre, whom Bolívar quite literally loved like a son. And for his part, Sucre went out of his way to not upstage the Liberator and always gave Bolívar full credit for the capture of Quito. He had no intention of playing Sulla to Bolívar’s Marius. And if you don’t get that reference, boy, I have a book that will explain it all to you, forthcoming from Public Affairs Press. ",
            "On June 16, 1822, Bolívar himself rode into Quito at the head of his remaining forces and was greeted by thronging crowds of jubilant residents. Sucre himself studiously kept out of the way and deferred all hails of liberator to Bolívar, soothing the general’s admittedly fragile ego. Bringing Quito into the Colombian fold was a huge accomplishment and one that would be celebrated without any hurt feelings amongst the senior commanders. What had been a ludicrous pipe dream back in Angostura in 1817, when they first claimed that all of New Granada would be a part of Gran Colombia, was now reality, and Gran Colombia was now whole. ",
            "For Bolívar, the capture of Quito was the end of one chapter in his life and the beginning of another. And not just in terms of his revolutionary career, but also in his personal life. Since the death of Pepita Machado back in 1819, Bolívar had been a bachelor. Yes, there had been some drama in Bogotá concerning a young woman who Bolívar fell for, but who did not fall for him back. But other than that, he had been on his own. And that all changed on June 16, 1822, because of a celebratory ball held the night of his arrival in Quito, Simón Bolívar met Manuela Sáenz, changing both their lives forever. ",
            "Manuela Sáenz was born out of wedlock in Quito in 1797. She was the daughter of a peninsular merchant and an unmarried criollo woman. So, like Bernardo O’Higgins, Manuela’s birth was a scandal. Deposited in an orphanage that specialized in such cases, the girl was raised in polite obscurity until her mother died when she was six years old. Now, normally, this would have left her in complete obscurity all on her own, but to the shock of his family, Manuela’s father decided he was not going to abandon her. So, without formally acknowledging paternity, he totally acknowledged paternity. He not only supported her financially but also routinely brought her around for any family function. So, though Manuela was an orphan, she grew to be a comfortable member of the local criollo society, though due to the circumstances of her birth, she would never be completely accepted. ",
            "So, Manuela’s peculiar insider-outsider upbringing mixed with a naturally precocious personality produced a young woman who was smart, self-confident, and did not give a damn about the conservative social and political values that had made her an embarrassment and got her mother shunned by her family just for the crime of giving Manuela life. By the time Manuela was a teenager, the wars of Spanish American independence were raging, and she became a fire-breathing patriot. When she was 17, her father arranged for her to be married to a middle-aged English merchant named James Thorne, who resided in Lima and who would become Manuela’s path out of the shadow of her orphan childhood. And though Thorne was, in many ways for her, a terrible match, he was a dull man of business, set in his ways, neither spontaneous nor looking for a good time, nor looking to upend the political order, but he was, in other ways, the perfect match. He did not try to contain his young wife’s energy, and while he traveled on business, he was happy to let her run the show back in Lima. A good bookkeeper and a persuasive negotiator, and now mostly free to run her life as she saw fit, Manuela enjoyed an independent life in bustling Lima. ",
            "Always a committed patriot, Manuela was thrilled at the arrival of General San Martín in 1821, and she became a fixture of patriot society after the liberation. So much so that San Martín actually gave her a medal for her work supporting the cause. But when news came along a few months later that Quito was about to fall, she hurried back home to see what she could do to protect her father. An old peninsular set in his ways, her father was not going to survive the new South American order without help. With luck, Manuela would be able to shield him from patriotic retribution, which probably meant securing him safe passage back to Europe. So, she arrived in Quito just ahead of Bolívar. And at the celebratory ball on June 13, 1822, the two laid eyes on each other for the first time. ",
            "Falling for each other instantly, the 25-year-old Manuela and 38-year-old Bolívar embarked on a passionate love affair. And whenever he could get away from official business, they were together. So much so that it would eventually become more convenient to simply mix business and pleasure. And Manuela would become not only his lover but an active partner in the future campaigns to liberate Peru and then the project to try to keep Gran Colombia together as the thunderous cannons of war gave way to the silent long knives of politics. ",
            "But for the moment, Bolívar did not yet realize that he had a partner in Manuela. And within a few weeks of arriving in Quito, Bolívar said, “I have urgent business in Guayaquil and I have to leave.” And it was urgent business. Bolívar had by now traded a further round of correspondence with General San Martín, and it had not been pleasant. The Protector of Peru had written the Liberator and said, “Hey, congratulations for all your success, but don’t even think about annexing Guayaquil.” To which Bolívar had replied, “Yeah, Guayaquil is totally a part of Colombia and I’m totally going to annex it.” But Bolívar did further say, “Let’s not do this by letter. You should come north; we should meet in person, and one great General to another, hash all this out.” So by mid-July, staying in Quito was no longer an option. After extending the invitation to San Martín to come north, Bolívar had to get to Guayaquil before San Martín did. ",
            "So, despite the furious protests of Manuela, Bolívar rode down to the coast, leaving her behind. And next week, Bolívar will indeed beat San Martín to Guayaquil, setting up a summit between the two great Generals that would see one of them depart the revolutionary stage forever."

        "paragraphs": [
            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "By the summer of 1822, General José de San Martín was not a happy man. After more than a decade of obsessive striving, he had finally fulfilled his dream when he triumphantly entered Lima in July of 1821. But that was probably the last time he was even remotely happy. Since then, he had been plunged into the vicious world of Peruvian politics, which was beginning to make the rivalries back in Buenos Aires look positively restrained. ",
            "As we’ve seen repeatedly, San Martín was not really cut out for politics. He was far more comfortable as a General than as a statesman. And for all the differences between San Martín and Bolívar — differences we’re going to talk about here in a minute — they shared a common preference for war over politics, it being far less treacherous terrain. But unfortunately for San Martín, there were now no campaigns to distract him. The last Spanish royalists had abandoned the coast and retreated to their strongholds in the mountains. And San Martín knew he did not have the men or the resources to go defeat them. So, unable to go off to war, San Martín had to sit in Lima. As the Protector of Peru, he tried to oversee the creation of a new government, but it was not going well. And the unhappy San Martín gave himself more over to opium and drinking, and letting his secretaries do the actual work. As the months passed, Lima’s disenchantment with the Protector began to grow. ",
            "And disenchantment was a common emotion for San Martín to leave in his wake. Back in Argentina, his name was still mud for stealing the Army of the Andes and never coming back; in Chile, he was now under suspicion because he had transferred all of his time and attention to Peru, leaving his old friends like Bernardo O’Higgins behind. San Martín had then gotten into a huge fight with Lord Cochrane after trying to buy the Chilean Navy, which also had not sat well with the Chileans. And then when Lord Cochrane had sailed back through Santiago, he warned O’Higgins not to trust San Martín. ",
            "Meanwhile, inside Lima, the Protector was caught between angry merchants who had been ruined by his blockade, conservative royalists just waiting for the Spanish to come back around, and then patriotic republicans whose support for San Martín was about to be dealt a crushing blow. And then everyone in Lima was equally ticked off that San Martín had left day-to-day operations to his chief secretary, a guy named Benito de Monteagudo. Monteagudo was imperious and arrogant. And with San Martín slumping through a life increasingly filled with opium, the secretary started playing Sejanus to San Martín’s Emperor Tiberius — which, hey, look, two Roman references in as many weeks. I wonder where my head is at these days. ",
            "Complicating all of this was the fact that his one base of support inside the city, the diehard patriots, learned a horrifying fact about San Martín. Because one thing that I have not yet revealed about San Martín — no, he doesn’t have another drug addiction — is that not only was he a centralist like Bolívar, he was also, gasp, a monarchist. Now, we haven’t seen hide nor hair of the centralist-monarchist quadrant of the revolution since about 1812, but through all his campaigns of liberation, San Martín was and would remain a monarchist at heart. Now, he was not a believer in conservative absolutism, of course. I mean, he’s an enlightened liberal freemason, after all. But San Martín thought a constitutional monarchy was the ideal structure of government. In his negotiations with the Viceroy of Peru to end the siege of Lima, San Martín had assured the Viceroy that he was open to a monarchy ruling liberated Peru. This did not sit well with his fellow revolutionaries when word got out, Bolívar himself couldn’t believe it, and he thought it was libelous propaganda that had been cooked up by San Martín’s enemies. ",
            "The revelations of this monarchism would also negatively impact San Martín’s dealings with Bolívar and the Colombians, though the more pressing issue was Quayaquil. San Martín had sent 1,200 men under Colonel Santa Cruz off to help Sucre defend Guayaquil and liberate Quito. But San Martín firmly believed that Guayaquil belonged to Peru, and he was furious that Bolívar and the Colombians seemed determined to steal it. And his recent correspondence with Bolívar had revealed that both men held mutually exclusive positions. San Martín expected Guayaquil to become a part of Peru. Bolívar was determined to make it a part of Colombia. So when San Martín heard that the Colombians had liberated Quito, San Martín knew that the confrontation over Guayaquil was coming. And so he boarded a ship to sail north to assert Peruvian sovereignty. He could not have been looking forward to the confrontation, but I imagine it was also nice to get out of Lima for a little while. ",
            "When San Martín departed, he thought Bolívar was still up in Quito and that San Martín would then have an opportunity to put in at Guayaquil for Peru’s claim to the city while waiting for the Colombians to come down out of the mountains to meet him. But as we saw last week, as soon as Bolívar dashed off his invitation to San Martín, he hopped on a horse and rode to Guayaquil as fast as he possibly could. So, it was to San Martín’s great horror that upon arrival at the port of Guayaquil on the evening of July 25, 1822, he was told that Bolívar was already there and waiting for him. Angry and embarrassed, the proud San Martín refused to get off the ship, as if he was the guest and Bolívar was the host, and a tense little standoff ensued. After more than a day of going back and forth, San Martín finally relented when Bolívar came down in person to board San Martín’s ship, him coming to San Martín rather than the other way around. Bolívar then led the Protector of Peru towards the palace where he would be staying, flanked by an honor guard of patriotic soldiers and pushing through throngs of jubilant inhabitants. The people of Guayaquil knew that they owed their freedom more to San Martín than to Bolívar. ",
            "In their first personal interactions, the two great Generals were a study in emotional contrast. San Martín was reserved, aloof, rigidly straight, and somber. Bolívar, on the other hand, was like an excited child, jubilant, pacing the room constantly, and on the verge of tears at the significance of finally shaking hands with the Great General San Martín. But underneath their different exteriors, both were doing exactly the same thing: sizing each other up. And though it would be lovely for the story if they departed as blood brothers who would remain fond pen pals for the rest of their lives, both would, unfortunately, leave very disappointed in the other. ",
            "Bolívar and San Martín had three private meetings with no aides or secretaries present, at which we know zero about what they said — no notes, not even a diary entry of what was discussed. But thanks to the correspondence between the two men we do have, leading up to the conference and then immediately after the conference, we know basically what the topics at hand were and what their respective positions were. No doubt exhausted by all the politics, both men were likely happy to begin by focusing on military affairs. The interior of Peru and Upper Peru, the future of Bolivia, were still in royalist hands. What are we going to do about it?",
            "San Martín basically wanted to know how many men Bolívar could provide for a campaign to dislodge the royalists and was gobsmacked when Bolívar said 1,000. By San Martín’s calculation, the Colombian army was 10,000 strong. So what is this “I only have 1,000 guys to spare” nonsense? He thought Bolívar was intentionally withholding troops. And nothing Bolívar said could convince San Martín that that really was all he could spare. And given how many Bolívar ultimately did send to Peru, San Martín does kind of have a point here. ",
            "Hitting an impasse over the army, they then ran into a similar impasse when they got to the big issue on the table: and that was the future of Guayaquil. San Martín said, “Of course, it’s for Peru.” And Bolívar said, “Yeah, well, technically it was part of New Granada and therefore it is now a part of Colombia.” Bolívar would finally recommend putting it to a referendum, a vote of the inhabitants of the city. But San Martín was not happy about that, as democracies are made of easily manipulated mobs. This of course raised the uncomfortable reality of San Martín’s monarchism, which not only didn’t he deny, but he tried to convince Bolívar was the only way to go. Bolívar was absolutely crestfallen to hear these words come out of the Protector of Peru’s mouth. The Colombians were all staunch republicans, and as much as it might – might – help diplomatic relations with the kingdoms back in Europe, it would undermine South American solidarity if it was the Kingdom of Peru and the Republic of Colombia. ",
            "By now, the two men were wary of each other’s intentions and none too thrilled about their revolutionary colleague. San Martín thought Bolívar an excitable little prince whose dashing charms were just a cover for manipulative glory hunting. Bolívar thought San Martín a dour crank wedded to conservative principles that had no place in the new South America, to say nothing of Bolívar agreeing with Lord Cochrane’s assessment that San Martín was careful and plotting to the point of cowardice. ",
            "And it was also clear to Bolívar now that the situation back in Lima was not a bed of roses, that San Martín was not popular there, and that his Sejanus was rubbing everyone the wrong way. No doubt this was all partially informed by Manuela Sáenz, who was deeply plugged into Patriot Society back in Lima. And in their final meeting together, Bolívar asked San Martín how things were going in Lima. San Martín said, “Oh, they’re going fine.” Bolívar said, “Oh, really? Because I’ve got a report of a coup against your secretary, Monteagudo. He’s been overthrown. What do you think about that?” And what San Martín thought about that was that it’s probably time for him to get out of this altogether. The whole thing, leave it all behind. ",
            "But Bolívar and San Martín kept up a united front for the people of Guayaquil. And on their second night together, the Liberator and the Protector shared a great banquet. Bolívar acted as host and San Martín as the guest of honor. They toasted to each other and to the glory of South America and to, you know, etc., etc. The raucous dancing and drinking went on long into the night, where Bolívar shined, and from which San Martín flinched. Probably now pushed over the edge. Dejected, full of self-pity, and watching the energetic Bolívar steal the show, San Martín decided that his work here was done, that with his dream of capturing Lima complete, it was time to hand the rest of the job over to Bolívar, who was obviously greedy for the opportunity to win the final victory for himself. ",
            "As San Martín would later say, there was simply not room in Peru for both of them, and San Martín was ready to be the one to bow out. At about 1:00 in the morning, San Martín signaled to his officers that he was ready to leave the banquet. His bags were already aboard the ship, and after bidding farewell to Bolívar, San Martín boarded his ship and sailed away without looking back. He had been in Guayaquil for less than 40 hours, and he would never see Simón Bolívar again.",
            "Upon his return to Lima a few weeks later, San Martín discovered that the story of the coup was true, and that his secretary had been ousted from power. Now thoroughly dejected, San Martín hung around in town long enough for the first official meeting of the newly constituted Peruvian Congress to meet on September 20, 1822. At the inaugural session, he announced that he was resigning from the army and relinquishing any political power he might hold. The Congress rose to applaud him, to praise his name, to heap upon him honors that reached to the stars, but nobody made a move to stop him. If San Martín was ready to go, they were ready to see him leave. And that very night, José de San Martín sailed away from Lima, never to return.",
            "So now that Bolívar and Lima have both bid farewell to San Martín, I think it’s time for us to bid our final farewell to him too. Enormously weary from ten years of revolutionary wars and plagued by physical ailments and drug addiction, you might think that San Martín would be dead within the week. But setting down his burdens appears to have revitalized him. Although his life in South America was soon over. He passed back through Chile on his way to his old province of Cuyo. He planned to settle amongst his old people, but the revolving coups back in Argentina now found the province under very unfriendly management. So by 1823, he was back in Buenos Aires, where he was treated with deep suspicion and encouraged to please keep moving along. His young wife having died while he was away on campaign, San Martín packed up his one daughter and sailed for Europe. They landed first in France, where the revolutionary liberal General was denied entry, forcing them up to London, where they stayed just long enough for San Martín to arrange passage to Brussels, where he would find his permanent home in exile.",
            "In Brussels, San Martín remained in contact with events back in South America, which were, god, just a mess of interconnected civil wars, and foreign wars, and everything in between. He actually sailed back to the Río de la Plata in 1828 to lend a hand in the war against Brazil, but upon arrival discovered that another coup had put his enemies back in power. So he turned around and headed back across the Atlantic without even disembarking. So, he was back in Brussels when the revolutions of 1830 broke out and he was invited by Belgian patriots to lead them in their secession from the Netherlands. But he declined and moved to Paris instead. There he was kept abreast of the further wars and civil strife back in his homeland, offering advice through a network of correspondents, many of whom were probably his old Masonic brothers. But he never returned to the actual fray. San Martín fled Paris on the eve of the revolution of 1848 and died in Bologna in 1850 at the ripe old age of 72. ",
            "When he sailed away from Peru, San Martín probably did not think that he had much longer to live. But shedding his burdens and leaving them for Bolívar, he managed to outlive Bolívar by 20 years. And in the end, he even found a few nice things to say about the Liberator — once the Liberator was dead, of course.",
            "So the stage was now set for Bolívar alone. But, like always, nothing was going to be easy for him. The royalists up in Pasto, who had surrendered after the capture of Quito, suddenly went back into rebellion in the late summer of 1822. And an old name was at the forefront of that rebellion because it was led by a young Colonel named Benito Boves. That’s right, the nephew of José Tomás Boves, the long-dead caudillo leader of the Legions of Hell. Young Colonel Boves gathered up royalist forces in the countryside outside Pasto and, in September 1822, started actively raiding the countryside. A month later, he was strong enough to enter Pasto with the help of sympathetic inhabitants and reclaim the city for God and the King. ",
            "Frustrated that this rebellion was getting out of hand, Bolívar dispatched Sucre back up to bring Pasto under control. But the campaign turned out to be hard and bitter. Sucre forced a battle on November 24, but was beaten back. He then had to wait a month before launching a more direct assault on December 22. This assault drove Boves and the royalists back into Pasto, with the patriots following close enough behind that they were able to push their way into the city too. The battle ended in bitter street fighting, with the patriot forces furiously venting their frustration on the population. Sucre’s men slipped out of discipline and sacked the city, killing upwards of 400 civilians over the next few unruly days. But even after their discipline was restored, the punitive measures on Pasto were harsh. Royalist leaders were arrested and executed, although Boves himself got away, and then a thousand more men, identified as suspicious, were conscripted into the Patriot army and marched to their new assignments down in Quito and Guayaquil, most never being allowed to return to Pasto. ",
            "While this was ongoing, Bolívar was himself back in Quito, trying to further consolidate Colombian hold of the region and mostly enjoying his time with Manuela Sáenz. As I said last time, Manuela was an ardent patriot and so committed to the cause that she habitually donned a dragoons uniform and joined in military exercises. Immaculate in her revolutionary politics and now proving her military mettle, Manuela was fast becoming not just Bolívar’s mistress, but, along with Sucre, really one of his principal revolutionary partners. ",
            "Nowhere was Manuela more valuable than in discussing affairs down in Lima. Personally plugged into the situation through multiple official and unofficial channels, she kept Bolívar in the loop about how things were progressing in Peru. And after the abrupt resignation and departure of San Martín, the question became how long should Bolívar wait before he moved south? And the conclusion the couple settled on was: we will wait until Lima is begging on bended knee for the Liberator to come save them, because anything less than that would cause everyone major political heartburn. ",
            "It took a little while for the real begging to come, though, even after a military disaster hit the Peruvians in January, 1823. The last 1,700 or so men remaining from San Martín’s liberating army — so we’re talking Argentinians and Chileans here — were cornered by a royalist army that descended out of the mountains and crushed them. All 1,700 men were either killed or captured. These were the best-trained troops in Peru. And just months after San Martín’s departure, the last forces he had brought with him, the final remnants of the Army of the Andes, was destroyed. This military disaster led to a political coup inside Lima that gave rise to a guy: José de la Riva Agüero. Riva Agüero wrote letters to San Martín begging him to return, but San Martín laughed in his face. Riva Agüero also requested aid from the Liberator, but Bolívar continued to bide his time, saying that he had not yet received permission from the Colombian Congress to leave Colombian soil. But really, this was about the begging not being hard enough yet. When Bolívar entered Lima, he wanted to be treated like the savior he believed himself to be. ",
            "By the spring of 1823, though, events were finally moving Bolívar down to Peru. With Pasto and the surrounding countryside quiet and the rest of the cities in the region seemingly peaceful, Bolívar felt like he could now really get the ball rolling, mustering the full strength of the Patriot army — that is, those brought originally by Sucre and then what Bolívar had come down out of Bogotá with, plus new recruits raised since their arrival — I mean, a good 6,000 total men. They were all sent down to Lima under Sucre’s command to pave the way for Bolívar’s eventual arrival. ",
            "You’ll notice that that 6,000 is quite a bit more than the 1,000 Bolívar said he could reasonably spare San Martín, which no doubt added a bit to San Martín’s later griping about Bolívar’s machinations. ",
            "But transferring this army down to Peru led to a host of new problems. For one thing, it turned out the royalist rebels in Pasto had only been biding their time.",
            "As soon as Sucre departed for Lima with the bulk of the Patriot army, Pasto re-rose in rebellion, forcing Bolívar himself to hastily raise a force of local militia that he personally led to re-re-suppress the rebellious city. Leading about 1,800 new recruits, Bolívar was able to put down this latest uprising at the Battle of Ebara on July 17, 1823. Though this would not yet be the end of Pasto’s resistance, it did help convince Bolívar that if he was going to be fighting, he might as well move on to the real show in Peru rather than wasting his time and risking his life for rear guard actions. ",
            "Fortunately for Bolívar, the situation in Peru was now getting pretty grim and the begging getting pretty fierce, much of it now coming from Sucre. Having arrived in June 1823 with 6,000 reinforcements, the new President Riva Agüero, said, “Good, I can lead these men out on campaign and start to clear the last of the damned royalists from my country.” But San Martín’s caution about going up into the mountains had never been about cowardice, always about a kind of ruthless prudence. 6,000 men was just not enough to get the job done. The march into the mountains alone was going to take its toll, and then they’d all have to immediately fight against well-defended royalist fortresses while likely suffering from altitude sickness. But Riva Agüero was ready to fight and so out he marched. ",
            "The big problem, though, was that this left Lima totally open. And as soon as Riva Agüero was out of the city, one of the main royalist Generals mustered fully 9,000 men and pounced. Sucre, who had been left behind to manage the defense of Lima with a meager garrison was lucky to have time enough to gather up the Peruvian Congress and deposit them in the fortress of Callao before the royalists entered the city. But this force was not here to occupy Lima permanently. That was no longer a part of the Spanish strategy. Instead, they resupplied themselves at will with forced requisitions and tribute demanded from the inhabitants at bayonet point. Sufficiently stocked up with wealth and supplies, they then marched south to go track down the Patriot army led by General Santa Cruz. So the temporary occupation of Lima was a bad blow, but it wasn’t fatal. It did, however, convince the Congress of Lima that they absolutely had to get Bolívar down here right now. Please, immediately. Do it. We beg you. ",
            "But just as Bolívar was finally hearing what he wanted to hear, he was also getting word of major trouble back home. Santander was now balking at Bolívar’s request to keep moving to Peru. It didn’t sound like Quito was well in hand, and the economic and political situation back here at home isn’t, like, great. Santander did not want the entire economy of Colombia to go towards Bolívar’s war machine. And then, way, way way back home in Venezuela, came news that might actually force Bolívar to turn around and return to Caracas, because the final coda of the Venezuelan War of Independence was about to play out. ",
            "After the Battle of Carabobo in 1821, the last royalist garrisons had retreated to Puerto Cabello, and there, even now in 1823, they continued to sit. The Colombians wanted to take the fortress, but there was no point in wasting time, men, or resources trying to do it. No reinforcements were coming from Spain, and there was no way for the Spanish inside the fortress to break out. So it was annoying that they were still there, but not, you know, anything to really trouble yourself about. ",
            "Leading this last rump of Spanish holdout was General Morales, he, too, of the old Legions of Hell. Well, after nearly two years of forced captivity, he was ready to break out. After coordinating with what was left of the Spanish Navy in the region in June of 1823, Morales surprised the Venezuelan garrison keeping an eye on him. He charged out of Puerto Cabello and headed west towards Lake Maracaibo, where royalist sentiment had always been pretty strong. But Morales was not going to get very far. General José Antonio Páez, the supreme military leader in western Venezuela, raised his llaneros from their subdued lethargy and rode down to box Morales up in Maracaibo; the rebellion would not spread. ",
            "But with Morales now trapped around Lake Maracaibo, something was going to have to be done about the Spanish Navy that was also now trapped down there with him. So in July 24, 1823, a Patriot navy of 22 ships cornered the small royalist fleet and brought them to battle. This Patriot fleet was led by Brigadier General José Prudencio Padilla. Now, since Padilla is a bona fide revolutionary hero and will come back around later to mark another stain on Bolívar’s career, I want to end today by telling you all about José Prudencio Padilla. ",
            "Padilla was born in the port city of Riohacha, northeast of Cartagena, in 1784. A dark-skinned, mixed-race son of a shipbuilder, Padilla spent his childhood around ships, and as a teenager, he joined the Spanish Navy as a porter. This was just in time for his ship to be called back for service in the Mediterranean for the Battle of Trafalgar. So young Padilla was there at the Battle of Trafalgar, and he was, in fact, captured by the British. He then spent three years as a prisoner of war before being released in 1808 and returned to Cartagena. When the first cries of liberty then started sweeping through South America, Padilla found himself an eager patriot, supporting all the early independence efforts in Cartagena and lending them what assistance he could. ",
            "But it took until 1815 for him to take on a more active role, when he joined General Bolívar’s army, when the Liberator had to come back down the Magdalena River, aiming at dislodging the royalists from Santa Marta, only to be fatally detained when Cartagena shut its gates to him. This is just before Bolívar departed for Jamaica to write his famous letter. When Bolívar departed, Padilla stayed behind, and so he was there for the siege of Cartagena. And when it came time to break out in December 1815, he captained one of the getaway ships that took the refugee revolutionaries first to Jamaica and then to the Republic of Haiti, looking for Bolívar. So you can add José Padilla to the list of men who were at the great revolutionary summit that was held under the auspices of President Pétion. ",
            "Padilla was then folded into Luis Brión’s little navy that would carry the revolutionary expedition back to Venezuela. And Padilla was a part of a forward guard that helped drive off the few Spanish ships in the area, clearing the way for the landing on Margarita Island. Now promoted to full Captain, Padilla served under Luis Brión in the far east as the patriots moved to the Orinoco River and captured Angostura. After Bolívar raced into the mountains and captured Bogotá in 1819, Padilla was put in charge of the Patriot siege of Cartagena, and there he remained until the city finally capitulated and the royalists evacuated. Promoted to Brigadier General in April of 1823, General Padilla became the highest-ranking pardo officer in the Venezuelan army, taking the mantle that had once been held by Manuel Piar, whose fate Padilla would himself share in a few short years. ",
            "But for now, Padilla was given command of the Patriot navy, operating in and around Lake Maracaibo just in time for the sudden crisis triggered by Morales to hit. Leading 22 patriot ships against the royalists, Padilla routed them decisively, and Morales signaled his complete surrender, departing the country for good in early August of 1823.",
            "Now, the Battle of Carabobo is considered the culminating battle of the War of Venezuelan Independence. But the Battle of Lake Maracaibo was truly the final nail in the coffin, as the royalists were now actually physically gone from the country and Puerto Cabello fell into patriot hands. Admiral Padilla was the hero of the battle and became a symbol of racial advancement in the new race-free world of liberated Venezuela. But unfortunately, as I mentioned, he would eventually share the fate of Manuel Piar, the man who had once held that same distinction of being the highest-ranking pardo officer in the Venezuelan army, executed by order of Simón Bolívar. ",
            "By the time the Battle of Lake Maracaibo was wrapping up, Bolívar was getting on a ship to sail even further away from home. After personally escorting royalists captured in Puerto Cabello down to Guayaquil, he received yet another letter from Lima, this one full of the kind of begging and pleading he could finally respond to. Having also finally gotten permission from the Colombian Congress to depart Colombian soil, Simón Bolívar boarded a ship in of August of 1823 and set sail for Lima, where he would begin the last great campaign of his career. ",
            "So we’ll leave the story off there as I take a temporary leave of absence. The manuscript for “The Storm Before the Storm” is due in four short weeks, and I am going to spend every waking minute between now and then making sure that the book is as awesome as I’m hoping you are all expecting it to be. I mean, hopefully, you’re not expecting it to be complete trash. I’ve been working on the book continuously now for this whole year while producing “Revolutions” full-time, and it feels pretty crazy that I might actually live to see this thing through to the end. But to finish it, I am going to go on an extended break and will not return with a new episode of “Revolutions” until January 15, 2017. After I come back, we will do the final hard charge of Spanish American independence, which should wrap up another five or six episodes as we liberate Peru and Bolivia and then send Bolívar back to Bogotá to dodge assassins and political enemies en route to his depressing but mercifully brief fifth and final exile. "

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "Okay, so I’m back. I managed to survive the last month and get the main script turned in on time, so everything is aces. The general timeline for the book from here on out, for those of you who have been asking, is that we plan to have all revisions and edits wrapped up by early March, and then it’ll move into production and marketing over the summer with an eye on releasing the book officially in October. The wheels do move slowly in publishing, but they are moving. ",
            "Meanwhile, back here at the Revolutions podcast, we have five more episodes of Spanish American independence, as Simón Bolívar first completes the liberation of South America and then slowly descends into a fatal labyrinth from which he will not return. After Bolívar slips the mortal coil in December of 1830, we will hop back across the Atlantic and then back in time just about six months to cover the July Revolution in France to set up the great failed revolutions of 1848. And 1848 will put a closing bracket on our age of liberal revolutions, because 1848 also happens to be the year the Communist Manifesto was published, and budding young revolutionaries will turn away from the kind of bourgeois Enlightenment liberalism they’ve been espousing and move on to proletarian socialism, communism, and anarchism that will be the principal drivers of our 20th-century revolutions. ",
            "So, getting back to it, if I’m not mistaken, we left Bolívar in Guayaquil in August of 1823, finally feeling begged enough to sail down to Lima to take over the struggle for Peruvian independence. And it would be quite a struggle. Not just because the last 19,000 Spanish troops left on the entire continent had taken up a strong position high in the Andes and were proving impossible to dislodge, but also because plenty of people in Peru were not interested in dislodging them. Of the four old viceroyalties — New Spain, Peru, New Granada, and the Río de la Plata — there’s no question that Peru was the most conservative and had largely been untouched by the successive waves of unrest that had been triggered elsewhere in Spanish America by the abdications of Bayonne and then the subsequent fallout from the Peninsular War. ",
            "As their neighbors fell to patriotic independence movements one by one, Peru had remained loyal to Spain. For the most part, the rich and prosperous criollo aristocracy of Lima looked on aghast as those independence movements folded in a degree of racial revolution, because both Bolívar and San Martín had succeeded thanks to armies composed of a motley array of blacks and Indians, pardos, mestizos, and everything in between. And if the choice was to remain with Spain and keep their existing racial hierarchies or declare independence and drown under a rising tide of blacks and Indians, Peru’s elite criollo seemed happy to remain with God and the King, as Simón Bolívar was about to discover.",
            "At the end of August 1823, Bolívar got on a boat and sailed south. On September 1, he arrived in the port of Callao that served Lima and made what was, for the moment at least, a triumphant entry into the great city. Bolívar was a well-traveled guy. He had been to Paris, Rome, and London, but certainly no city in the Americas could match the splendid opulence he found in Lima. Built from the silver hauled out of the mines up in the mountains, Lima was filled with magnificent churches and palaces that were all now draped in festive decorations to greet the Liberator. Bolívar would soon learn, however, that those who espoused patriotic slogans only did so when they thought the patriots were going to win. And many of those out there welcoming him with open arms were willing, even eager, to go back to God and the King at the first opportunity. ",
            "Navigating these treacherous and duplicitous waters would literally suck the life out of Bolívar. And he would ultimately conclude that Peru was a chamber of horrors, confirming his diagnosis in the letter from Jamaica that the Viceroyalty of Peru was fatally corrupted by gold and slaves, of which he said in the letter, “the first corrupts all it touches, the second is corrupt in and of itself.”",
            "But for the moment, everything was splendid. There was good food, good drink, lots of parties, lots of socializing. Manuela Sáenz was, of course, right by Bolívar’s side, introducing him around to the society that she herself was a prominent member of. It was only mildly awkward that Sáenz was married to another man. To keep up the thinnest of appearances, she officially lived in her own house, but spent her nights with Bolívar in the house that he had commandeered, the same house San Martín had lived in during his own unhappy years in Peru. ",
            "It had been a full year now since San Martín had left, and in that time, the Peruvian government he had helped inaugurate in September of 1822 had been buffeted by defeat and treachery. The President of the new Congress was supposed to be José Bernardo de Torre Tagle. But a defeat at the hands of the Spanish just a few months later led to a military coup spearheaded by General José de la Riva Agüero.",
            "But as we saw last time, when Sucre showed up to pave the way for Bolívar’s arrival, it was Riva Agüero who had gone marching out to confront the Spanish in July of 1823 and instead left Lima wide open and undefended, allowing a Spanish army to march in and strip the city clean. And it was that sack, more than anything else, that led the begging of the patriot leaders in Lima to reach the proper pitch to draw Bolívar down from Guayaquil. With Bolívar now likely on the way, Torre Tagle reasserted his claim to the presidency with the help of lavish bribes to key members of the Congress. So before Riva Agüero made it back to Lima, he found himself ousted from power. But instead of accepting this counter coup, Riva Agüero refused to relinquish the presidency and instead fled north to Trujillo, a good-sized port on the Pacific coast about halfway between Guayaquil and Lima. ",
            "So when Bolívar walked into Lima, he found the government fractured, with two men claiming to be president. Bolívar, for his part, recognized the Congress in Lima, led by Torre Tagle, and entered negotiations to determine what the Liberator’s role would be in Peru. The Congress wanted to vote Bolívar full dictator, which is blanket political, military, and economic authority. But as usual, Bolívar scrupulously avoided the job. He wanted only full military authority. The political power should remain in civilian hands, and Torre Tagle should remain president. It’s just another reminder that Bolívar shared with George Washington a passion for being a military hero rather than a political tyrant, and both wanted sovereign authority to stay out of the hands of military heroes. On this front, Washington was the North American Bolívar, and Bolívar was the South American Washington. ",
            "So on September 2, the Congress appointed Bolívar Supreme Military Commander. Bolívar then wrote letters to Riva Agüero, imploring him to stand down, accept the government, and unify the patriot cause. But now, extra resentful that Bolívar had come down from Colombia to hog all the glory, instead, Riva Agüero did an about-face. He opened up a channel to the Spanish and said he was ready to talk about joint operations to evict the patriots and return Peru to Spanish rule. But for the moment, Riva Agüero’s treasonous treachery did not extend to his senior officers. They were unwilling to go along with the betrayals and instead arrested Riva Agüero and shipped him down to Lima. President Torre Tagle naturally wanted to execute him, but Bolívar intervened and put Riva Agüero on a boat to Europe, and that is the last we will ever hear of him. ",
            "With the Patriot government now unified under President Torre Tagle, Bolívar assessed the military situation. Up in the mountains looming high above Lima, the Spanish had about 19,000 men spread across Peru and Upper Peru as far south as La Paz. For the past decade, these forces had fended off incursions both from Argentina and coastal Peru without really too much effort at all, and they still held the mines that were the true economic engine of the continent. These last Spanish armies were now led by Viceroy José de la Serna, a general who had forced his way into the job in the wake of San Martín’s arrival back in 1821. He had withdrawn into the mountains when Lima fell to San Martín’s army of the Andes. Alongside De la Serna was a French-born general named José de Canterac who had come to South America with the armada of Pablo Morillo and then migrated south down to Peru. Canterac had been the principal Field Marshal for all the operations around Lima and had developed a healthy disdain for the Patriot military. He personally remained undefeated in the field against them and had recently led the capture and methodical sack of Lima. Also serving under Viceroy De la Serna was an unreconstructed royal absolutist named Pedro Olañeta, who was as opposed to treasonous liberal Spaniards as he was to these patriotic American dogs.",
            "Taking over command of the American dogs, Supreme Commander Bolívar inherited four armies in various states of disrepair. They were now mostly Peruvian conscripts, as nearly all of San Martín’s veterans from the Army of the Andes had either been killed, captured, or gone home. Though it does appear that I misspoke last time when I said that they were all gone because, while I was prepping this week’s show, I found about 1,500 Argentinian cavalry still holding the fort down in Callao, and I didn’t realize that they were there, but they’re still there. ",
            "The commitment of the Peruvian conscripts, however, was shaky at best, and indeed, shortly after Bolívar assumed command, one of these armies marched into the interior with 5,000 men and returned home with only 850, and they never even fought a battle. Mother Nature and terrible morale had done all the necessary damage. ",
            "While Bolívar assessed his dismal situation and tried to figure out a plan of attack, he took to trying to make this a great Pan American enterprise to evict the last remaining Spanish. His simple argument was that so long as any Spanish remained on the continent, nobody on the continent was safe. ",
            "But by now, everyone else had their own problems. Buenos Aires and Montevideo were entering into yet another round of civil war mixed with a foreign war against Brazil. The last thing they wanted was for another San Martín to wander off with one of their armies and never come back. Down in Chile, Bernardo O’Higgins was personally a committed Pan American patriot, and he even traveled to Lima to meet with Bolívar. But having fought and won independence, most of his fellow Chileans wanted to focus on securing their country, not go marching off to try to liberate another one. The vaunted Chilean Navy elected to stay in Chilean waters and not get sucked into war in Peru. So Bolívar’s letters, treaties, and begging were falling on deaf ears, and he was going to be on his own. ",
            "Nowhere was the refusal to respond more maddening than from Vice President Santander and the Colombian Congress in Bogotá. Though, to be fair, no one was more sick of listening to Bolívar’s begging than Vice President Santander and the Colombian Congress in Bogotá. It had now been two years since the Liberator had ridden out of town. He was supposed to go secure Quito on his way to Guayaquil to make Gran Colombia a reality. And after one year of hard fighting, he had done it. Gran Colombia was now unified. But instead of coming back, Bolívar had kept going and taken a Colombian army with him. Now, every time Santander opened a letter from Bolívar, it was demands that Colombia send men, money, guns, food, anything, everything, down to Peru. And it’s not like the economy of Gran Colombia was awesome after a decade of nonstop revolutionary civil war, it was hard to just keep the country afloat without sending much-needed resources out to be consumed by Bolívar, as he tilted now at Peruvian windmills. ",
            "The correspondence between Bolívar and Santander became curt and accusatory and then ultimately quite silent. And it was one of those times where both sides were wrong and both sides were right. Bolívar was right that they couldn’t leave a Spanish stronghold on the continent, and also right to point out that none of them would have gained their independence had not foreign troops been of assistance. The Venezuelans had fought for New Granada, the New Granadans had fought for Venezuelans, and then they had both fought together for Quito.",
            "But now nobody wanted to keep going and help the Peruvians. Santander was right that this was getting expensive, and endless overcommitments might reverse what they had already achieved. Bolívar’s point was that leaving the Spanish in place would destroy Colombia. Santander’s point was that pursuing them might also destroy Colombia. ",
            "Helping Bolívar deal with these frustrations was Manuela Sáenz, who now moved beyond just being another of Bolívar’s mistresses. She was so fiercely invaluable that Bolívar enrolled her in the army as a cavalry officer with all due rank and pay, and put her in charge of his papers. From that position, she kept a central eye on all his affairs and became a clearinghouse for patriotic correspondence and planning. So she now traveled with his entourage, not merely as his girlfriend, but as one of his principal secretaries and advisors. ",
            "But for a variety of reasons, Sáenz did not accompany Bolívar on the inspection tour at the end of 1823 that nearly killed him, and so the couple became separated for far longer than either imagined. By now, the years of revolutionary toil were taking their toll on Bolívar. Though still only in his mid-40s, he was prematurely aged from years of earning that affectionate nickname “Iron ass”. And while returning to Lima in early January 1824, he contracted a severe fever. The fever was so bad that the ship he was on had to dock at a random little village on the coast. And there, in a small house, Bolívar drifted in and out of consciousness for an entire week, and he very nearly died right then and there. Even when the fever finally broke, Bolívar was in terrible shape. Always short and trim, Bolívar emerged from the fever a hollow-eyed skeleton. He was unable to travel and had to post up in this tiny little village for two full months. And for weeks, he took audiences from behind a curtain so that people did not see how frail he had become. And ironically, it was because he was in such bad shape that it was agreed that Manuela Sáenz would not rush to his side to care for him. They were both afraid it would spark dangerous rumors in Lima that the Liberator was finished. ",
            "Now, whether it was because of Bolívar’s condition or just a coincidence, just as Bolívar was beginning to pull himself together in February, he was handed grave news from the capital: that Argentine garrison holding the fortress of Callao mutinied because they had not been paid in approximately forever. So just like that, the patriots lost control of the all-important port servicing Lima. In the wake of this drastic emergency, the Patriot Congress declared Bolívar dictator. They gave him all authority, whether he wanted it or not, and Bolívar just had to accept it this time. But President Torre Tagle sniffed at the offense of being so easily brushed aside. And as President, he himself was intimately familiar with the military and political situation and determined that, at this point, the Spanish were likely to prevail. ",
            "So on February 27, 1824, President Torre Tagle and 350 high-ranking military officers, political officials, and congressmen defected and declared their allegiance to God and the King. Now obviously, this had been worked out in advance with Viceroy De la Serna, who promptly announced that with the capital back in royalist hands, an army would be arriving shortly to secure the situation. The defection of Torre Tagle sent the truly committed patriots of Lima into a hasty flight, with most everyone streaming north for the relative safety of Trujillo. Among those fleeing the capital was Manuela Sáenz. The Spanish arrived and retook the capital two days later. ",
            "But by the time the Spanish were recapturing Lima, Simón Bolívar was personally mending and finally ready to travel after a two-month convalescence. He sailed for Trujillo, reunited with Sáenz, and there scrambled a response. Bolívar established a provisional Patriot government in exile in Trujillo, using his powers as dictator to dole out an array of titles and ministries — something he was by now a pretty well-practiced hand at. True to Bolívar’s outlook and predicament, the government’s principal job for the moment was winning the war. ",
            "And for the first time in his life, Bolívar did not just go racing off chasing glory. He carefully planned his next move. Very much as San Martín had done in Cuyo, Bolívar redirected everyone and everything in Trujillo towards the war effort. Men manufactured war material. Women sewed uniforms. Everyone contributed silver and all other metals, precious or otherwise. Cattle, mules, and horses were all pressed into service. Bolívar also, of course, conscripted like crazy. And he soon had about an equal number of Peruvians to go along with the 5,000 or so Colombian veterans who formed the core of his army. He drew these recruits from the ranks of the lower classes, from the pardos and mestizos and Indians who, unlike the elite criollo of Lima, looked forward to liberation, real liberation. And they were ready to fight for it. ",
            "As his army came together, Bolívar also developed a plan to take the fight into the interior. Control of Lima obviously meant nothing. The capital had changed hands multiple times over the past few years with no obvious change to the balance of power. As long as the Spanish remained in the ancient Incan fortresses of the high Andes, Peruvian independence was impossible. And those Spanish forces could remain in the rich and fertile valleys of the interior indefinitely. And their close proximity to the mines meant that their men were always paid on time and in full. So there was very little hope that those Spanish armies would just disintegrate of their own accord.",
            "So, as he drilled his new soldiers, Bolívar sent Sucre ahead to scout the way through the valleys and foothills that parallel the mountains south. And once that route was scouted, Sucre was to identify the best route up into the mountains near the mining region of Pasco, where they would meet the first major garrison on the road to Cusco. That garrison of 2,000 men was located in the fertile valley around Lake Junín and led by General Canterac, living a very comfortable life and reading reports of patriot activity with leisurely contempt. ",
            "But all was not well on the royalist side. Had they stayed united, it is likely that the coming campaign would have gone very differently. But the die was cast, even as Bolívar lay in bed recovering from his near-fatal fever. The conservative Spanish general Olañeta decided that he was the only one left on the whole damn continent fighting for the true principles of Bourbon absolutism. So, suddenly refusing to take orders from Viceroy La Serna, Olañeta withdrew with his army deep into the south in the middle of January 1824. La Serna could not live with this threat in his rear. So, even as Spanish forces were retaking Lima, La Serna was forced to peel off a good third of his total army and dispatch them south to bring Olañeta to heel. And then, even after Bolívar recovered and began building an army out of the city of Trujillo, he was still not briefed on the depth of his enemy’s troubles. It wasn’t until the end of April that he was told that the Spanish were actually up in the mountains fighting a war against themselves. And when he got this news, all of his old instincts fired. He called a war council and laid out the situation for his officers and then called on a young Colonel to offer the first opinion of what the army should do. The young colonel surveyed the maps and said, “I think we should attack at once.” So Bolívar rolled up all the maps and said, “This boy has taught us all a lesson. We march in the morning.” ",
            "So by mid-May 1824, 9,000 men and 6,000 heads of cattle were on the move south, keeping the mountains to their left as they followed the valleys towards the place that Sucre had identified as the best place to start going up. Bolívar led the army from the van and with Manuela Sáenz in the rear, with all his papers and Bolívar being Bolívar, he carried on an affair with a local girl that he met along the way. This led to furious messages from Sáenz in the rear, but both being fairly libertine in their habits, when the army kept moving, the girl went home and Sáenz returned to Bolívar’s side after – no doubt giving him an earful. ",
            "By July, the army was preparing to enter the mountains. And as was standard for crossings into the Andes, it was not going to be an easy march. Narrow paths that skirted sheer cliffs, various mountain streams and rivers and waterfalls that were chasms, bare, hard, cold, wet rock. But this is a new-look Bolívar we’re dealing with here. And he did think ahead this time. The advance crew under General Sucre had stashed supplies all along the planned route and had even built rudimentary shelters along the way. This planning would help keep attrition to a minimum as the army began a slow, sometimes single-file climb up into the mountains. ",
            "As Bolívar’s army approached Canterac’s position in the valley of Junín, where he was sitting with 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, the French general did not seem particularly concerned at all. Bolívar may have a reputation, but Canterac dismissed him as an overhyped, empty shirt who had not yet met a real army or General in battle. And it’s not like patriot armies hadn’t attempted to come up into the mountains before, but Mother Nature had always taken care of them. So Canterac didn’t even try that hard to keep tabs on Bolívar, and it came as something of a surprise when, on August 2, 9,000 men suddenly started emerging onto a high mesa overlooking the Valley of Junín. And even then, it took Canterac another four days to decide that he should probably do something. The thing he decided to do was order a retreat out of the valley. And that’s when Bolívar came down to try to stop him. ",
            "So on August 6, Bolívar personally led about 900 of his cavalry down onto the plains by the lake, many of these being old llaneros veterans who had volunteered for further service, many of whom had now been fighting for Bolívar for years. Canterac responded by sending his own thousand cavalry out to try to buy the infantry time to escape the valley. And the two sides started dancing around each other, and then they started making sweeping passes at each other, and pretty soon, alternating revolving waves of cavalry started clashing. Except it was all done exclusively with swords and lances. No sound rang out except for the pounding of horse hooves and the cries of wounded men. And by this point in the history of war, this was practically unheard of. But if it was going to be a battle of lances, Bolívar’s cavalry was eventually going to win. And they did, proving to Canterac that he was dealing with a much different kind of army than he had in the past. These guys deployed the old retreat, chase, and turn trick that Páez had taught them long ago. Much to Canterac’s surprise and dismay, his cavalry started taking heavy casualties — 400 dead and wounded and another 100 captured. But the survivors of this skirmish escaped, as did the entire infantry, all of them now running towards Cusco. Bolívar’s liberating army then poured into the valley. And after one lousy cavalry skirmish, the emotional course of the war flipped, with Bolívar’s men now believing that they were destined for victory while the Spanish aura of invincibility had been permanently shattered. ",
            "Once again, though, it was a more tempered Bolívar running this campaign. So rather than putting on the rocket skis for Cusco, the Liberator fanned his men out across the valley to consolidate their political and military authority and generally make the region a new forward base for supply and defense. He also got word that in the wake of the Battle of Junín, the Viceroy La Serna was finally prioritizing Bolívar over the renegade conservative Olañeta and was massing upwards of 12,000 men in Cusco to properly respond to this Patriot army now in their midst. ",
            "So that Patriot army remained in the Valley of Junín for two full months. But by October, Bolívar was about to restart the campaign, only to be hit by heavy rains that made any march logistically impossible. So he ordered the army to settle down and wait it out. But Bolívar himself decided that with the campaign idled, he should make a return trip to Lima. The Spanish army that had moved in after Torre Tagle’s defection had moved on again after beefing up the garrison at Callao, and again taking any supplies they could find. So there was a good chance Bolívar would be able to restore Lima to patriot hands, even if Callao itself would remain out of reach and looming ominously on the coast. So, leaving Sucre to lead the army, the Liberator retraced his steps back down out of the mountains. ",
            "It was while on the road back to Lima at the end of October 1824 that Bolívar received devastating news. The Congress in Bogotá, at Vice President Santander’s instigation, had voted to strip Bolívar of the presidency and all military authority that had been granted to him by Colombia. The justification was that by accepting the dictatorship of Peru, Bolívar had abdicated his claim to sovereignty in Colombia. The Congress further ordered that Bolívar immediately give up control of all Colombian forces to his second in command. Now, as fate would have it, that second in command was General Sucre, the ever-loyal protégé of Bolívar. Had it been practically anybody else, it’s possible Bolívar would have rejected the order from Bogotá. But instead, he raged in his tent and then wrote two letters to Sucre. The first was his official public notice of the orders from Congress; the second, a personal letter to Sucre, where he blistered at the perfidy of the politicians in Bogotá but told Sucre to accept the change in command. Not yet 30, General Antonio José de Sucre was now Commander-in-Chief of the Patriot army. ",
            "Now, Sucre and Bolívar’s other senior officers were, of course, outraged by all of this, but Bolívar forbade them from ignoring the Congress or from breaking off the campaign against the Spanish just on his account. He still had the power and authority vested in him as dictator of Peru, and he could wield it back in Lima to the benefit of the greater cause. But though he took the removal of his command in remarkable stride, there is no question that Bolívar would have been crushed. He was a General. He wanted military glory. That’s what he was always after. Now he was going to be forced to sit on the sidelines, and all the glory would go to Sucre, who had already kind of stolen his thunder in Quito when he found the third sister. I mean, really, if it had been anybody but Sucre who Bolívar was handing the army over to, this all would have played out very differently.",
            "Over the next few weeks, though, Bolívar continued to pick his way down out of the mountains, headed for the district around Lima. And then he finally got some good news. Though everybody else had abandoned him, way back off in his home of Venezuela, José Antonio Páez came through. Though he too was no happier about Bolívar’s demands than anyone else, he at least complied. Páez sent 4,500 men on a long march south to reinforce the Patriot cause in Peru. These men were arriving in the country just as Bolívar was descending from the mountains, and though he had been stripped of his Colombian authority, Bolívar asserted his authority as dictator of Peru, put himself at the head of these troops, and led them to Lima. ",
            "So yet again, an army marched virtually unopposed into the capital. Ex-President Torre Tagle and his fellow defectors, plus any remaining Spanish troops, fled into the fortress of Callao. With his enemies trapped inside the fortress, Bolívar began a siege in early December, just a few days before Sucre fought the great decisive battle of Ayacucho. ",
            "Bolívar’s last order to Sucre — well, recommendation, really, since he had been stripped of his ability to give orders — was for Sucre to maintain a strong defensive crouch and not get sucked into a battle. It was one thing to overwhelm a small garrison, quite another to take on the cream of the Spanish army, and Bolívar doubted the Patriots’ capacity to win any battle up in the mountains, not for the least because the Spanish were far more acclimatized to the thin mountain air. But Viceroy La Serna was not going to let Sucre just avoid a battle, and in late November, he marched out of Cusco to go hunt down and destroy the Patriot army. ",
            "Sucre did his best to follow Bolívar’s recommendation and avoid a confrontation with the Spanish. But recognizing that La Serna was trying to swing around him and cut off his line of retreat to the north, Sucre mobilized his forces and led them through a series of deft retreats that prevented the Spanish from outflanking him. But eventually, La Serna’s forces proved too fast and too well acquainted with the terrain, and after a few weeks dancing around each other, Sucre determined that if he was going to make it out of this, he was going to have to turn and punch La Serna right in the nose.",
            "So on December 6, near the plains of Ayacucho, Sucre decided to stop running. With other contingents of his army spread out on their own lines of retreat, Sucre had about 5,800 men under his direct command, while up in the hills overlooking Ayacucho were more than 9,000 Spanish. They had a nearly two-to-one advantage and held the high ground. But Sucre was now determined to fight, and it would seem that just as Bolívar was becoming more prudent, his protégé was picking up the most gloriously reckless of the Liberator’s old habits. ",
            "On December 9, 1824, the two sides lined up for battle, and from La Serna’s perspective, things could not be better. He had the numbers, he had the high ground, and all of his best officers were running his army. Sucre didn’t even have an artillery, well, he had one single solitary cannon. But it’s not like the Spanish troops were in great shape. They had been marching like crazy over the last few weeks and were now badly under-provisioned. They were tired and they were hungry. But when the battle started, it predictably went against the patriots, who endured artillery fire and a steady press of Spanish infantry and cavalry.",
            "But then, at the center of the patriot lines, a young cavalry general dismounted his horse and shot it in the head. He told his fellow officers that he wanted no opportunity to escape. Then he ordered everyone to pick up their long llaneros lances, and the next time the Spanish cavalry charged, the patriot center didn’t just stand firm, they charged right back. The spears played hell with the Spanish horsemen, and after a half hour of intense fighting, Viceroy La Serna could only look on helplessly as the patriot center not only held but surged forward. Rushing the Spanish artillery positions on the hills and capturing them. With his army now suddenly buckling, La Serna ordered a massive infantry to go retake his artillery positions, but they failed and were sent reeling backward. In the midst of all this, his Generals then started getting wounded and captured. Canterac was among them. And then, in a humiliating blow, La Serna himself was surrounded in his command tent and taken prisoner. Everywhere else, his soldiers were either dead, or in full retreat, or in the process of being captured. They left 1,900 dead on the field, with another 2,500 now prisoners of war. General Sucre lost only 310 men. ",
            "At the Battle of Ayacucho, General Sucre won a battle worthy of Bolívar in all of his old glory. Sucre had been outnumbered. He charged uphill against superior forces. And not only was it a great victory, but it was the final victory. With La Serna captured and his army destroyed, there was no Spanish resistance left in Peru — or practically nowhere else. The only remaining Spanish forces now followed Olañeta south of La Paz. Bolívar himself well knew what this victory meant when he heard about it. He was not expecting Sucre to fight a battle, let alone win one so decisively. When he heard the details, he wrote: ",
            "“General Sucre is the father of Ayacucho. He is the redeemer of the children of the sun. He has broken the chains with which Pizarro bound the empire of the Incas. Posterity will picture him with one foot on Pichincha and the other on Potosí, bearing in his arms the cradle of Manco Capac and contemplating the chains broken by his sword.”"

            "Hello and welcome to Revolutions,",
            "The surprise victory at Ayacucho ended Spanish rule in South America. On the eve of the Abdications of Bayonne way back in 1807, the Spanish controlled millions of square miles of land from Mexico on down to the tip of South America, but after nearly 20 years of revolts, insurrections and wars, they had lost nearly everything. It was a stunning disintegration of a 300 year old empire. Now, they still controlled Puerto Rico and Cuba, but on the continent they were now down to just two tiny pockets of stubborn loyalty. ",
            "In Upper Peru, the conservative General Olañeta ignored Viceroy la Serna’s order to surrender and defiantly prepared to resist to the bitter end. Joining his defiant resistance was the garrison commander of the fortress of Callao. He too, refused an order from la Serna to surrender and instead prepared to withstand a brutal siege. Neither will succeed, however, and by the end of today’s episode, both of those pockets of stubborn loyalty would also be gone. ",
            "With Spanish rule now a thing of the past, South America entered a transitional phase, and a map of the continent in 1825 would not be recognizable today. Colombia was still a large superstate containing Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Panama. Down in the Rio de la Plata, chaos continued to rain, and nobody knew how it was going to shake out. The territories that would one day become Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil were still a hot mess of civil war and cross border conflict. Peru was Peru, but its border with Colombia to the north and Chile to the south would be a source of future conflict and debate, to say nothing of the looming question of what to do with Upper Peru. ",
            "Now, given his obsessive need to swim against the tide to plow the sea, as he so eloquently put it, Simón Bolívar hoped that when the dust of revolution settled, that there would be four great countries that emerged from the old Spanish possessions roughly conforming to the boundaries of the old vice royalties. But as we’ll see today, the centrifugal forces of federalism were already fatally undermining Bolívar’s dream of large centralist superstates taking root in South America. The leaders of South America did not agree on much, but they all agreed that they did not want to live in giant superstates, especially not superstates ruled by Simón Bolívar. ",
            "But though the map of South America in 1825 is not the same map that exists today, the transformation of the continent from Spanish colonies to free and independent nations was finally being recognized by the rest of the world, at least the English speaking world. As we’ve seen over the course of this series, the attitude of both the United States and Britain towards the Spanish revolutionaries was always guarded and neutral. The British would not risk their alliance with Spain while the Napoleonic Wars was ongoing. And then, even after Waterloo, Britain was hesitant to upset the reactionary postwar European balance of power. Now, we’re going to talk more about this when we get to the Revolutions of 1830, but after the Congress of Vienna, international politics in Europe was broadly directed by the so called Holy Alliance between Austria, Prussia and Russia – old style conservative monarchies opposed to liberalism, democracy, and anything that even hinted at revolution. ",
            "Britain’s early postwar policy was to work in concert with the Holy Alliance, forming what is called the Quadruple Alliance, which then became the Quintuple Alliance in 1818, after they folded in the fully restored Bourbon monarchy of France. Among other things, this concert of conservative powers resolved in the early 1820’s to oppose the Carbonari Revolt in Italy, the budding drive for Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire, and, of course, the liberal mutiny of the Spanish army in 1820, which we talked about back in Episode 5.17. ",
            "To deal with this last, and for us at this moment, most relevant threat, the Quintuple Alliance met in Verona in October of 1822 and approved a plan that would allow France to invade Spain, nullify the liberal constitution that had been established and restore full, absolute power to King Ferdinand VII. The British were not thrilled by this plan and would not help it in any way, but they also determined it would be fruitless to try to stop it. So in early 1823, just shy of ten years since they had been kicked out of the country, the French reinvaded Spain, successfully scattered the Liberal government and restored absolute power to King Ferdinand, all of this bringing an end to the period of Spanish history called the Liberal Trienium. It should come as no shock that the King would soon be making noise about the need to restore all of Spain’s old dominions in America to their rightful place, their rightful owner. But even Fernand’s closest allies were skeptical that this was remotely possible. The same French government that had just used its army to restore his absolutist throne was not interested in helping Ferdinand restore the Spanish empire to its former glory. Instead, the French entered into bilateral talks with the British to work out a shared response to the question of South America. ",
            "After these talks, British Foreign Secretary George Canning issued the Polignac Memorandum in October of 1823, taking its name from the French Ambassador to the court of St. James. The memorandum said that the British and French would not help Spain recover her lost colonies, but neither Britain nor France had their own territorial ambitions in South America and that they would also not pursue exclusive trading rights in the Western hemisphere. Economic free trade and political independence would be the order of the day in South America. ",
            "Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the United States watched the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the rise of the Holy Alliance with unease. Since George Washington had first put his stamp on the presidency, the guiding foreign policy of the United States had been avoiding entanglements in European affairs. Now, they had not been successful at this, as the Quasi War with France and the recent humiliations at the hands of the British in the War of 1812 attested. But still, at the tail end of the Virginia dynasty, the general policy of Presidents and Secretaries of States was still to try to maintain a general neutrality, which let them stand offish towards their South American cousins who you might think, given the United States’ own history and professed ideals that the government would gladly arm and support. Now, this left the South Americans understandably bitter and disappointed by the alleged Beacon on the Hill that was the United States of America, even more so because they well knew that the United States was not acting out of high minded principle so much as prioritizing the acquisition of Florida from the Spanish. Unwilling to upset those negotiations, the US refused to send boat loads of guns to rebels in South America and even made it a crime for American citizens to do so in a private capacity. ",
            "But with the old Conservative monarchies on the rise, and Florida finally secured, President James Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, worried about the hemisphere reverting to its old order, with European monarchies carving up and dominating the Americas. Now, as I just said, the British shared this concern, and they did not want to lose access to South American markets, so they talked to the United States about issuing a joint statement respecting South American independence and protecting everyone’s access to trade. But with the bitter hangover left by the War of 1812 still lingering, President Monroe refused a joint statement and instead plotted an independent course. In March of 1822, Monroe formally recognized Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Mexico as independent nations. Then, a year and a half later, the president addressed Congress in December of 1823 and declared what has become known to history as the Monroe Doctrine, though it was mostly written by Secretary of State Adams, the Presidents get naming rights on their policies.",
            "Monroe said ",
            "“The occasion has been judged proper for asserting as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.”",
            "But a major caveat applied to this general principle of keeping Europe out of the Americas. Monroe went on to say. ",
            "“With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power, we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principles acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards the United States.” ",
            "So if you’ll recall from our final episode on Haiti, this formula of the Monroe Doctrine implicitly left out the second nation in the Western hemisphere to win independence because the United States still recognized Haiti as a colony of France. ",
            "The Monroe Doctrine also did not include Puerto Rico or Cuba, which were still recognized as colonies of Spain, nor did it include any other colony of any other nation that had not yet declared independence. ",
            "But of course, the most important thing to understand about the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine is that it was utterly toothless and everyone knew it. In 1823, the United States was a minor power with no real navy. And ironically, the only thing that can enforce America’s grandiose declaration that Europe stay out of the Americas was the British Navy. But luckily, the British were seriously interested in shielding their own access to South American ports and did, in fact, stand opposed to European powers trying to reclaim lost territory, particularly the Spanish. ",
            "And so the British position evolved from the British not recognizing South American independence to claiming neutrality in the conflict, to finally recognizing Mexico, Colombia and Argentina on New Year’s Eve 1824. Which was pretty good timing because this was just weeks after the Battle of Ayacucho marked the de facto end of the Spanish in the Americas. ",
            "Though they were now formally recognized by the governments of both the United States and Britain, the South Americans would continue to redefine what it is they want the rest of the world to actually recognize. And the looming question about what to do with Upper Peru would mark the beginning of the end of Bolívar’s dream of four large nations run by centralized governments and the beginning of the beginning of the 16 decentralized nations that would emerge after his death. ",
            "Now, actually, liberating Upper Peru turned out to be easier than anyone expected. After General Sucre finalized the terms of Spanish surrender with Viceroy la Serna, he prepared to go hunt down and capture General Olañeta. Sucre wasted very little time getting going and by mid February 1825 Sucre’s army had crossed the border into Upper Peru and entered La Paz not just unopposed, but to open arms. The remaining, quote unquote Spanish troops in the region were more often than not local recruits who welcomed the general amnesty Sucre had sent ahead. He was offering to absorb both enlisted men and officers at equivalent rank and pay into the Patriot Army. ",
            "So there was no war of Bolivian independence as such. The march to liberate Upper Peru was marked not by battles but by peaceful defections. The utterly intransigent Olañeta, however, held out with his last few remaining loyalists, but in April of 1825, he was killed fighting in a minor skirmish. And since he was the only casualty of that skirmish and all of his men then promptly defected to Sucre, it is widely assumed that Olañeta was assassinated by his own men. And this is why Ayacucho gets to go down as the last battle of Spanish American independence. Because by the end of April 1825, Upper Peru was in Sucre’s hands and he had hardly fired a shot in anger. "
