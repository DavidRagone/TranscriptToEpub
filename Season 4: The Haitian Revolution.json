            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "Welcome to the beginning of our fourth revolution together, and one that is a bit different from the rest. The English, American and French revolutions are all regarded as huge turning points in history. Often studied, often discussed, and at least moderately understood by the general public. They at least know that it happened. But the Haitian Revolution is not like that. For a variety of reasons, the story of the collapse of the French slave colony of Saint Domingue and the eventual declaration of an independent Haiti is little known. And even those who know that it happened know almost nothing about the details. If anything, you might know that it was the only successful slave uprising in history, and that indeed it was. But it was so, so much more than that. And as we trace the history of the Haitian Revolution from the initial revolts of 1791 through the Declaration of Independence in 1804, hopefully you’ll walk away appreciating how much the Haitian Revolution deserves to take its place alongside its more famous brethren as one of the most fascinating and important revolutions in world history. ",
            "So today we’re going to cover the early history of Saint Domingue, talk some basic economics and geography, and then move on to a discussion of the three main groups who inhabited the colony and who will serve as the main players in the revolution: the whites, the free coloreds and, of course, the slaves. With the building blocks in place, we can then spend next week talking about the insane web of tension between and within these groups as we approach the beginning of the French Revolution back in France, which will put into motion a parallel revolution in Saint Domingue that will fully erupt in 1791. Before we get going, I’d like to start with my usual disclaimer about how I am about to butcher the holy living crap out of French. But I’m also just going to keep on trying, because what else am I going to do? ",
            "Our story begins in 1492, when Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Seriously, it does. Columbus’s fleet of three ships arrived in the New World in October 1492. After exploring around the Bahamas and then Cuba, Columbus sailed over to the big island southeast of Cuba in December 1492. The native inhabitants of the island, the Taíno, called their home Haïti, but Columbus promptly dubbed it Hispaniola. It was while anchored off the northwest coast of the island inside the borders of modern Haiti, that the Santa Maria ran aground on Christmas Day, 1492. With permission from the local Taíno chief, Columbus built a little settlement using salvage material from the ship and called the settlement La Navidad, in honor of the sunken Santa Maria. He left 39 men behind and sailed away. When Columbus returned the following year, he found all 39 men dead. The local Taíno chief blamed a raid by the rival Carib people, but nobody knows what actually happened to them. ",
            "After Columbus’s initial voyages, the Spanish continued to explore and settle the New World and in the early years, they used Hispaniola as their springboard. In 1496, they established the port of Santo Domingo on a deep and protected harbor on the southeast side of the island. Santo Domingo became the capital city and Hispaniola was often referred to amongst the Europeans as simply Santo Domingo. ",
            "As the Spanish were primarily on a quest for gold, the native Taíno Indians of Hispaniola were systematically rounded up and put to work mining what limited precious metal the island contained. They were subjected to this forced labor under the encomienda system whereby the Spanish protected natives in exchange for service and it was slavery in all but name. The regular order of Taíno life was destroyed and replaced by brutal slave gang labor. Between European diseases, murderous overwork and regular suicide, the indigenous population plummeted from somewhere between 500,000 and 750,000 in 1492 to just 29,000 in 1514. ",
            "Along with looking for precious metals to extract, Columbus and the men who followed him also brought with them the critical crop of our story: sugarcane. Sugar originally came out of the Middle East, migrated over to Western Europe, and was now being imported into the Caribbean in the hopes that it might be a lucrative cash crop. By the 1530s, there were more than two dozen sugar mills in Hispaniola, all of them on the east side of the island near Santo Domingo. But though the Spanish were ultimately correct about the future profits of sugar, the further development of Hispaniola was arrested by Spanish gold discoveries on the South American mainland. The draw of Inca and Aztec gold led the Spanish to virtually abandon Hispaniola, and by the late 1500s, the island was a complete colonial backwater, inhabited only by an array of small cattle farmers. ",
            "But just as Hispaniola was slipping off the Spanish radar, it was showing up on the French radar. In the beginning of the 1600s, both the French and the English started making forays into the New World and challenging Spanish and Portuguese hegemony. Their first move was to sanction privateers, both officially and unofficially, who preyed on Spanish treasure ships. The British set up their first major foothold in the Caribbean, in Barbados. The island was claimed in the name of King James in 1625, and then his son, Charles I established it as a proprietary colony in 1627. Hey, look, we know those guys. Hi, Stuarts. Long time no see. ",
            "The French, meanwhile, claimed Martinique and Guadeloupe, and pretty soon every rocky outcropping in the Caribbean was claimed by some European power or another. The native population was, of course, annihilated. ",
            "Right around this same time, the mid 1620s, a coalition of French and English pirates who became known as the Brethren of the Coast set up a base on the small island of Tortuga. Tortuga lay off the northwest coast of Hispaniola, on the opposite side of the island from the Spanish capital of Santo Domingo. Though the Spanish had massively deprioritized Hispaniola and only sparsely settled the west side of the island, they were not too happy about the appearance of these intruders, especially when some of them started setting up shop on mainland Hispaniola, supplementing their pirate income by hunting the wild cattle that now roamed the island, smoking the meat and selling it to passing ships. This smoked meat was called Buccan, which is how these guys became known as buccaneers. The Spanish and pirates battled for the next few decades over control of Tortuga (I think the island changed hands at least four times), but the pirates always wound up coming back. ",
            "In 1665, this independent little pirate colony on Tortuga asked the French crown to appoint a royal governor to give their settlement official legitimacy. The request was granted by young Louis XIV. A royal governor arrived with 400 additional colonists, beginning the transition of the region from pirate base to more settled colony. By 1680, the community numbered some 6000, with planter colonists now far outnumbering the old pirates. Finally, at the conclusion of the Nine Years War in 1697, the Spanish officially ceded the western third of Hispaniola to the French. And since the island was now generally referred to as Santo Domingo, the French colony took the French version of Santo Domingo: Saint Domingue. It was one of the last European colonies to be established in the Caribbean, and from its humble origins as a mere pirate base, it would soon rise to become literally the most lucrative single colony in the New World. ",
            "As the French took possession and started settling plantations, a pretty even mix of African slaves and white indentured servants were imported to provide labor. French indentured servants were only bound for three years, whereupon they got a chunk of land for themselves. In the early days, the small planters focused on tobacco, since it cost very little to get a tobacco farm off the ground. But by the early 1700s, North American tobacco was a well oiled machine, and there was no way some small planters in Saint Domingue were going to compete. So tobacco was quickly abandoned. ",
            "Another early crop that did wind up taking root was indigo, which was used to produce dye for the growing textile operations back in Europe. It required a smallish amount of initial capital to get started, but once you got going, you could make a pretty decent living as a small indigo farmer. And indigo wound up being a staple of the Saint Domingue economy. By the time of the revolution, it was solidly number three on the list of the big three crops. The other two were, of course, sugar and coffee, which became not just staples of the Saint Domingue economy, but they became staples of the world economy. By the 1780s, Saint Domingue was producing a huge portion of Europe’s sugar and fully 50% of its coffee. It was indeed exports from Saint Domingue that transformed both from aristocratic luxuries to staples of the everyday diet. ",
            "Now, coffee arrived on the island much later, but sugar landed almost as soon as the French took over, and immediately it became the signature crop of the colony. Now, getting a sugar plantation off the ground is incredibly expensive. You needed a ton of specialized equipment to actually extract the sugar from the cane, and then if you wanted to refine it, you needed even more specialized equipment. So getting into sugar was a rich man’s game to begin with, and even then, it was going to put you into some serious debt before you harvested a single crop. This kind of outlay obviously lent itself to large plantations rather than tons of small freeholds. Most of the financing came from merchant houses in the French Atlantic port cities like Nantes and La Rochelle and Bordeaux. If your plantation turned out to be a success, then fortunes were there for the taking. But if, for whatever reason, you happen to faceplant, the merchant houses took it over. And ultimately, about half the sugar plantations in Saint Domingue were owned by these merchant houses and run by salaried administrators. ",
            "Making a sugar plantation profitable required a ton of manual labor, and after the death of Louis XIV in 1713 and the end of his incessant wars against the rest of Europe, the French were able to plug into the African slave trade, mostly run by the Portuguese at this point. Indentured servants were completely abandoned in favor of Africans, who were considered more suited for working in the climate. Some poor whites did try to emigrate to the colony, hoping to strike it rich somehow, but diseases and lack of capital doomed them all to an early popper’s grave. So as the colony grew, it was mostly a very small clique of white planters and administrators and a ton of slaves, which through the middle of the century were coming in at about 10,000 to 20,000 a year. In 1687, shortly before the official takeover by the French, the population of Saint Domingue was about 4000 whites and 3300 slaves. By 1715, it was 6600 white and 35,000 slaves. By 1730, the white population had barely moved, while the slave population was up to nearly 80,000. In 1750, the numbers were 14,000 whites and 150,000 slaves. ",
            "The pattern of settlement in Saint Domingue pretty much followed the geography of the colony. Sugar needs flat land that is well irrigated to grow on. So the initial settlement boom was in the plains of the north. Now, I made a map of the colony. Hey, you remember when I used to do that? So you can follow along with all this at home, because it is important to understand the geography of the colony. The plains in the north were the first to be staked out, as they were well run through by streams that made it ideal for raising sugar cane. The early sugar boom in the north led the port of Cap Français, to become the most important city in the colony. It actually wound up as one of the most important cities in the Western Hemisphere, usually referred to as Le Cap, which is what I’m mostly going to call it, so I don’t have to mangle Cap Français all the time. By the time of the revolution, the city had a population of nearly 20,000, so roughly the size of Boston on the eve of the American Revolution. Le Cap was the capital of the colony from the time it was founded in 1711 until the royal headquarters were transferred down to Port-au-Prince in 1770 for reasons we’ll talk about next week. ",
            "As the lucrative sugar plantation surrounding Le Cap made money hand over fist, the city rapidly grew and soon became known as the Paris of the Antilles. It was in every way a modern European city with a regular gridwork street pattern, stone construction, it boasted 1500 seat theater, cafes, philosophical societies, the works. It also became quite possibly the busiest port in the Western Hemisphere, with ships constantly coming and going. The communication lag time between France and Saint Domingue will become a running joke as the colony tries to keep up with the French Revolution. But though news often ran six weeks behind, the news did come in daily as ships departed France for Le Cap almost every day. ",
            "Once all the best land in the north was taken, colonists started to move south into what will become the Western Province. The largest city of the Western Province, Port-au-Prince, was founded in 1750, and it was a poor cousin of Le Cap, as were all the other quote unquote cities in the colony, which most of them were like glorified villages. There were two large plains that suited sugar production in the Western Province, though they were drier than the plains in the north and required concerted irrigation to make them work. The Northern Province and Western Province were separated by a steep mountain range that did not have a real road cut through it until Port-au-Prince was founded. So travel between the provinces was usually done entirely by water. ",
            "South of the Western Province was the Southern Province – a thin, east-west running peninsula of mountains that jutted out of the southwest side of Hispaniola. The western and southern provinces were likewise divided by sharp mountains. Haiti has some of the steepest and tallest mountains in the Caribbean, and that topography is going to be important as we watch the revolution unfold. The rougher terrain in the south made it less well suited to sugar and was thus the last province to be settled and ultimately the least populated of the three. The south indeed had a different character than the north, which was well connected to life back in Europe. International traders were probably willing to swing down to Port-au-Prince after arriving first in Le Cap, but after that, it was harder to convince them that it was worth it to keep on going. The main city of the Southern Province, Les Cayes, was actually on the other side of the peninsula. It was on the Caribbean Sea side, not the Atlantic side. So the Southern Province tended to be a bit more independent minded than the Western and Northern Provinces, and they look to rival colonies in British Jamaica and Spanish Cuba, not as rivals at all, but as trading partners. Even though all of this was technically illegal. Contraband trade was a staple of the economy in the south. ",
            "So after all the good sugar land was taken, the next huge boost to the economy came when the coffee bean arrived, as the colony was hit with an influx of new colonists after the end of the Seven Years War, these guys discovered that they could grow coffee in the mountainous regions where sugar could not. So there was a major economic boom as coffee plantations sprang up everywhere. And because the coffee was not in competition with the sugar for land or resources or even buyers, it was just a pure addition to the profit side of the colony’s ledger. Consumers back in Europe became addicted to both sugar and coffee, and collectively, the sugar, coffee and indigo plantations turned Saint Domingue into the single most lucrative colony in the New World. I’d call it a gold mine, but by this point, it was more lucrative than the Spanish gold mines. ",
            "So with a little history, geography and economics under our belt, let’s move on to the three main groups who inhabited the colony and who will be the major players in the coming revolution: the whites, the free coloreds, and the slaves. ",
            "So to start with, the whites, they were actually divided into two informal groups: the grands blancs and the petits blancs. That is, the big whites and the small whites. And since a ton of my books just go ahead and call them the big whites and the small whites, I am going to too. The big whites were at the very top of the colonial pyramid. They represented a combination of the major planters, and the principal traders and merchants in the colony. The leading planters were usually younger sons of nobility who had been looking for a way to establish an independent fortune for themselves often after a stint in the army. The big whites dominated colonial life. They owned practically everything and everyone. But there’s one important thing to understand about the big whites. They were not really looking to make Saint Domingue their home. Their investments in the colony were about laying the groundwork for a fortune that would sustain them while they lived in France, where things were decent. Caribbean life was dangerous, with its tropical diseases; monotonous, with its never changing seasons and oppressive heat and boring with only a few gambling dens and brothels to keep you entertained. The idea was to get out as soon as you possibly could. Of the main sugar plantations in the north, fully half were owned by absentee landlords who did their best to never come visit their estates in person. But that said, at any given time, major landowners and traders did live in the colony, and they were the dominant political and social force. ",
            "The small whites, then, were all the other whites, and they were the men who actually ran the colony day in and day out. These could be the managers and stewards, agent of the absentee landlords, salaried employees of the merchant houses. And then on down in the urban areas, you would find minor lawyers and notaries, various shop clerks and skilled artisans. Also thrown into this mix were the vagabonds that you always find in a colonial port city: runaways, ex-pirates, failed immigrants who had nowhere else to go. None of them did any manual labor or worked as a servant, because those jobs were exclusively done by slaves. ",
            "Out in the rural areas, all the small whites worked on the plantations. If a plantation was absentee owned, the hierarchy basically looked like this: a hired procurer lived in the nearest city and had power of attorney over the estate. The procure would hire a manager, [who would] actually live out on the plantation, and run the operation. Below the managers were overseers who actually monitor the activities of the slaves. And these overseers were usually drawn from the ranks of the urban poor or from the ranks of newer rivals who had no other prospects. The plantation managers were, as a rule, the biggest bastards on the island, even more so than the big white owners. All the managers wanted to do was make enough money to get the hell out of there, and they had very few scruples about how they were going to achieve that goal. With little actual oversight, they outright stole from their employers, stole from their slaves, put slaves to work on personal projects, and were free to abuse any slave who dared challenge them. The managers would be prime targets for the machetes during the initial rebellion. ",
            "Above and between the big whites and the small whites was a little group of royal administrators – all native French, all there to do their jobs, make some money, and get out. At the top of the royal administrative hierarchy was the royal governor, a soldier whose principal occupation was the defense of the colony. He had at his disposal two regiments of regular soldiers and control over the local militias. But the governor also had a wide and often self proclaimed and self serving jurisdiction over judicial and administrative affairs. Technically, though, this was all the purview of the second man in the administrative hierarchy, the intendant, who was the head civilian and whose portfolio included justice and finance. Beneath these two were about 500 salaried bureaucrats who represented the will and power of the King in the colony. And as we will see next week, these royal officials were often at loggerheads with the big whites, who resented these bureaucrats coming in and bossing them around. So that covers the white population, and on the eve of the revolution, they numbered about 30,000. ",
            "Since 99% of the men who sought their fortunes in Saint Domingue were, duh, men, the colony was soon populated with a significant number of free coloreds. Now, you will see them sometimes referred to as the mulattos, but no one today calls them that because, (A) it’s a slur, and, (B), as we’ll see next week, it’s technically inaccurate according to the handbook everybody started using to determine racial status. The free coloreds were the product of the unions of white men and black women and then the subsequent interrelationships between everyone over the years. Now, oddly enough, race prejudice was not particularly strong for most of the history of the colony, and there was nothing abnormal about a white man taking a black mistress or black wife. Indeed, according to the law, if a white man married a black slave woman, she and her children automatically became free. ",
            "But aside from the, dare I call them, positive relationships where a white master married a black slave, raised colored children, and lived happily ever after, there was also a ton of just straight up rape. And if one of the sexual assaults happened to produce a child, many of the fathers were happy to keep both the mothers and even their own children in slavery if it suited them. ",
            "But over time, more and more free colored children grew up and became free colored adults. And then they intermarried with each other or with other whites or other blacks to produce more free colored children. And soon there was a whole free colored community. By the time of the revolution, this community was just under 30,000, so almost as large as the white population. And according to all French law, there was nothing about race itself that barred you from enjoying normal rights. They could do anything any free Frenchman could. They could marry, enter into contracts, live wherever they wanted, get educated, inherit property, bequeath property without limit or restriction. The wealthiest of the free coloreds were not as rich as the big whites, but they did amassed considerable wealth and property over the years, including, of course, slaves to work on their estates. Slavery was an economic condition at this point. It was not a racial condition. And even men who had themselves been freed later owned slaves. ",
            "Newly arrived white men were all too happy to marry free colored women because they were often very well connected and came with property that would immediately vault the newcomer into the property classes. As we will see next week, however, after the end of the Seven Years War in 1763, French colonial policy would change and create a legal category of ‘nonwhite’. And we will talk about why they did this and what the consequences were for everyone. ",
            "So that brings us finally to the slaves. On the eve of the Haitian Revolution, there were more than 500,000 slaves in Saint Domingue. To put it another way, 90% of the population of the colony was a slave. By way of contrast, the ratio of Free to slave in the American South on the eve of the American Revolution was just a bit under 50/50. One slave per Free inhabitant. In Saint Domingue, this ratio was ten to one. So this was not a society that had slaves. This was a slave society. ",
            "Once slave imports to the French side of Hispaniola got going in earnest, after 1713, about 10,000 to 20,000 slaves were brought in annually. They were imported by way of the Triangle trade, which was European ships heading down to the African coast, loaded with merchandise that would be then traded for slaves. Then those slaves would be transported to the New World, where the new slaves would be sold and the product of existing slaves would be loaded back up and taken to Europe to sell for a huge profit. ",
            "The usual process of enslavement began with either direct European raids into the interior of West Central Africa or with tribes selling other tribes to the whites, often enemies defeated in various tribal conflicts. These new slaves would then be marched to the coast, sold to European traders and packed into the holds of ships, with about 3 by 5ft allotted to each human being for the long voyage across the Atlantic. The hold of a slave ship is one of the most nightmarish things you can imagine. Just putrid, sick, suffocating, the dead piling up around you as you have no room to move or to breathe. About 15% of the Africans would die enroute. The rest would emerge malnourished, weak and traumatized. The slave ships would then stop off at various ports of call to sell the men and women to eager colonial buyers. In Saint Domingue, this would usually took place in Le Cap. And upon being purchased, the slave would be branded and led off to whatever fate awaited them.",
            "If they survived the voyage, the mortality rate of a new slave was roughly 50% after three to five years. This was due to overwork, disease, malnutrition, severe punishment, and as often as not, work accidents. With such an incredibly high mortality rate, the economic calculation among the slave owners was to work slaves as long and as hard as they could before they died, and then just purchase replacements. There was no sense of protecting their investment by treating the slaves well, because the value of the individual slave was nothing compared to the profits being made from his or her work.",
            "Over the course of the 1700s, roughly 675,000 slaves were imported into Saint Domingue, and combined with contraband off-the-books imports from the British or the Dutch, that number might have hit a full million, or about 10% of the total trade in African slaves in the whole sorry history of the business. The rate picked up markedly after the end of the American War of Independence, which freed up the New World economy and its trade routes. In the mid 1780s, slave imports hit 30,000 to 40,000 a year, and then peaked in 1790 with 48,000 new arrivals. The mortality rate of the slaves, coupled with the huge influx of new slaves, meant that on the eve of the revolution, 70% of the slaves and fully two thirds of the colony’s population had been born in Africa. ",
            "When a new slave arrived at his or her plantation, they found themselves in an alien world. For one thing, the enslaved Africans represented an array of tribes who spoke a variety of languages, practiced their own customs, and were just different people. If history had reversed itself, and it was Africans who enslaved Europeans and not the other way around, this was basically some new English slave being thrown into a plantation with some Germans, a few Italians, Russians and Norwegians, all white, but all different from each other. And that’s to say nothing of the men and women born into slavery who already spoke Creole – the mix of French and African that was the lingua franca of the colony. The new arrivals were just thrust into this alien world, and some of them might have been chiefs or respected leaders back home, and being reduced to slavery was an intolerable affront to their dignity. They actively resented their condition, and they were likely to resist or just commit suicide after a few years. ",
            "The treatment of slaves was allegedly governed by the Code Noir, which had been promulgated in 1685, and that applied to slaves and owners in all French colonies. Slaves were legally human property, but they did have some basic protections. The owner was supposed to provide adequate provisions, two new sets of clothes per year, and educate them in Christianity. There was also a provision allowing for a slave to appeal to royal authorities in cases of mistreatment, but you can imagine how many slaves were told about that clause. In practice, though, the Code Noir was just ignored. For example, owners found it much less expensive to give the slaves small pots of land to work for themselves, to produce enough food to sustain themselves rather than pay for provisions. Thus, any period of rest or day off for the slaves were not for rest at all, but rather for working your own plot. But these plots did provide a small way for slaves to make a little money, because they would often take some of their produce down to the Sunday markets to sell. All with the master’s permission, of course, because one of the best ways to keep a slave docile is to hold out the hope that they might one day be able to buy their freedom, which was something that happened just enough to hold that hope out there. ",
            "So, to take your average sugar plantation, the able bodied men, that is, not counting children, old men, if they existed, and the recent arrivals, worked in the field, this meant digging canals, tilling the soil, planting the sugar cane, and then harvesting it. They would rise just before dawn, work until a short breakfast, then go back to work until midday, break, and then go back to work until sundown. This was repeated every day but Sunday, week in and week out, until you dropped dead. And in case you’re wondering, yes, cutting and harvesting sugar cane with a machete is awful. The plants are very sharp, you get covered in little nicks and cuts, and then the sweat gets into the cuts, and if you’re exhausted and just stop working for a minute, you get whipped or beaten. I mean, this is pure misery. This is real slavery. ",
            "Once the cane was cut, it had to be immediately fed into mills to squeeze the juice out, because if the cane sat out, the juice would turn starchy and lose its all important sweetness. So, during the harvest season, which ran from December to July, the mills would be run practically 24 hours a day by rotating teams. And this is usually what the women did. The combination of overwork and lack of sleep would inevitably lead to accidents. And if even a little part of your hand got caught in the mill, it was liable to just suck your whole arm right off. And mutilated slaves were a common sight on every plantation. After the juice was pressed, it had to be boiled for hours and stirred constantly. Don’t fall in or get hit with any boiling hot sugar or again, its death and mutilation. Then this hot liquid would be poured into a mold to harden for shipping back to Europe, where it would net the owner of fortune, leaving behind it, of course, a trail of mutilated and dead bodies. ",
            "And the plantation itself, as we’ve already discussed, was run by a manager and his hired white overseers. But the actual running of the plantation was done by drivers, slaves themselves, who actually ran the work gangs. They were the ones who got the slaves up, put them to work, made sure they stayed working. They controlled the whip and dealt out all punishments. Almost always Creole slaves that is, slaves born in the colony. They were given perks and special status because good drivers were the difference between a successful plantation and a failing one. But though these drivers basically worked for the whites, they were also the leaders inside the slave communities. And when the revolt came in 1791, they were the principal leaders of that revolt. ",
            "So, the sugar plantations used up most of the island’s slaves. But if you got lucky, you might get sent off to a coffee plantation, where the work was merely monotonous rather than fatal. Coffee plantations were also usually smaller and far less likely to be owned by absentee owners, which usually meant conditions were better. About 80% of the rural slaves worked out in the field, with the other 20% working in the households, performing every duty a house required: cooks, maids, butlers, nurses, or performing skill jobs like coachmen, barrel builders, sugar production assistance, which required a great deal of training. This led to a natural house slave/field slave dynamic, with the better treated house slaves tending to identify with their masters rather than the field slaves. But as with the drivers, the house field distinction was by no means rigid. And many of the principal leaders of the revolt and the men who would one day rule the island came from the ranks of these privileged slaves. Toussaint Louverture was a coachman, and the future Emperor Henri Christophe was a waiter. These privileged slaves were the men who would overthrow their masters. ",
            "Okay, so now that we’ve got some good background material to work with, we’ll be able to turn to the complex interrelationship between and within these groups. And next week, we will pick up the threat of colonial history in about 1763, with the end of the Seven Years War, which brought major changes to French colonial policy. And by the time of the revolution, everyone will be at everyone else’s throat over everything. And when the year of revolt comes in 1791, it is not just the slaves who will rise up. Everybody is going to go into revolt against everybody else.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So, last time, we introduced Saint Domingue, the French colony that occupied the western third of the island of Hispaniola. We also introduced the main groups who inhabited the island: the whites, the free coloreds, and the slaves. And I did my best last week to discuss each group in isolation from each other, because today I want to focus in on the relationships between and within the groups. Relationships that formed a complicated web of tension that defined the island in the late 18th century as France approached the French Revolution, and Saint Domingue approached what would one day be known as the Haitian Revolution.",
            "Now, we could start practically anywhere. But let’s start first with the tension between Saint Domingue collectively and the mother country, France. And in the context of this relationship, France is always called the Metropole, which simply means the parent state of a colony. So when I say metropole, I just mean France proper. We’ll start here because it is the tension between Saint Domingue and the Metropole that will eventually kick start the revolution in 1791. ",
            "So, in the big picture, the French overseas empire was governed by mercantilist theory, which essentially means that trade between the mother country and the colonies should be done entirely in house and operate for the benefit of the Metropole. The purpose of a mercantilist colonial empire was to produce goods that could then be exchanged with other mercantilist empires the British, the Dutch, the Spanish, with the balance of trade, hopefully in your favor, that is, you wanted them to give you more gold for your stuff than you gave them for their stuff. The object of the mercantilist system was to accumulate more gold than everyone else. ",
            "In the French colonial context, this meant that the planters of Saint Domingue labored under a restrictive framework called the Exclusive. Promulgated by the Great Controller General Jean-Baptiste Colbert during the reign of Louis XIV, the gist was that all colonial exports had to be sold back to France and all colonial imports had to be bought from France. And it’s safe to say that in the whole history of Saint Domingue, the colonists hated the Exclusive because it depressed the price of their exports and increased the price of their imports. Without any outside competition, the French merchant houses in the Atlantic port cities paid less for sugar, coffee and indigo than the planters believed they could get in an open market. And then those same merchant houses charged more for goods and provisions and machinery than the stuff was really worth. It was incredibly frustrating for the colonists. And what was doubly frustrating was that fully 3/4 of Saint Domingue’s sugar and coffee were destined to be reexported to other countries. So rather than the colonists selling directly to British traders, they had to sell it for far less to French merchants, who then marked up the price and pocketed the profits of exportation. And since the merchants back in France were growing incredibly rich, thanks to their monopoly, they had way better access to the inner circles of court. And so, despite colonial protests, the Exclusive stayed put. ",
            "Now, key point: how did the colonists know they were being undercut and overcharged? Well, that’s easy. Despite the Exclusive, the colonists carried on a robust contraband trade with everybody. There was a thriving internal economy in the New World, and Saint Domingue was right in the middle of it. Buying and selling with Spanish Cuba, British, Jamaica, the British colonists up in America – it was all off the books and winked at, but it was a key part of everyone’s colonial economy. And even more than that, it was critical to those economies because sometimes French merchants couldn’t meet colonial demand. And where else were you going to get the stuff you needed to survive but from the British and the Dutch and the Spanish, who were all quite happy to trade with Saint Domingue and try to break the Exclusive? ",
            "Now, the first true revolt that hit Saint Domingue was actually in opposition to restrictive trade policies set by the Metropole. In the 1720s, one of those odious state chartered monopolies so beloved by mercantilists, the Company of the Occident, was granted all kinds of special monopoly privileges over Saint Domingue. Tension in the colony finally blew up in late 1723, as a group of angry women stormed the company headquarters in Le Cap and smashed it up. Then the next night, there was further rioting and a company owned plantation was burned to the ground. This unrest then spread out over months until the powers that be back in Versailles decided to back off and withdraw some of the privileges. ",
            "Now, if this incident sounds a bit familiar, you’re right, because this resembles nothing if not the conflicts between London and its North American colonies in the run up to the American Revolution. This mob action in 1723 is precisely the same sort of action that the Boston merchants got up to over the Tea Act. Which was what? Trade privileges for a state chartered monopoly. And as we will see in almost every way, almost, the big whites in Saint Domingue are basically the same type of colonists with the same basic ideas as the men who ran the American Revolution. These are the major planters and the principal local merchants. Their aims are going to be free trade and self government. George Washington and John Hancock were big whites. ",
            "So that brings us to our next big tension, which is between the royal administrators who ran the colony and tried to enforce the Exclusive and the big whites who were starting to believe that they should run the colony. ",
            "Now, as we discussed last time, Saint Domingue started out as an unruly pirate base. So the administration of the colony reflected the need for a strong hand to impose order. The governor general was a soldier and the colony was essentially run under military rule, which is to say that justice was heavy handed and verdicts arbitrary. As time progressed and the colony evolved into being a settled planter society, the leading big whites came to resent their treatment and started advocating for more self government and more respect for their individual rights. I mean, they were reading their John Locke about property and Montesquieu about constitutional government and they were looking on jealously at their British counterparts in Jamaica and North America who enjoyed a degree of self government. And they said, why not us too? ",
            "So to keep the big whites in check, the royal administrators tended to exploit one of the main lines of tension within the colonial white community: the mutual loathing of the big whites and the small whites. The small whites were the guys who struggled as direct overseers and managers out on the plantations or as low level clerks in the cities. New arrivals who dreamed of making a fortune were themselves thrust into an exploitative world of their own that kept them locked in place while the big whites made all the money. Now, it was of course possible to rise up through the ranks. Men did it all the time. But as often as not, the small whites wound up stuck in a demoralizing job with no way out. So the small whites resented the hell out of the wealthy and arrogant big whites. And recognizing an opportunity to contain big white ambition, and to carry some popular support, royal administrators were eager to side with small whites when they filed grievances or brought lawsuits against the big whites. ",
            "Now, the big whites in turn despise the uncouth small whites who were always lying and stealing and loafing around drunk instead of doing their jobs. And this particular tension between the big and small whites is going to be really important once the French revolution gets going, because guess who the small whites are? That’s right, they are the Sans-culottes, and they are going to be just as eager as their cousins back home to pin on a revolutionary cockade and overthrow the hated old order. But just remember, the big whites are not counterrevolutionary royalists. They are the liberal nobles and the rich bourgeoisie who represented the first revolution, the revolution of 1789. The small whites, meanwhile, represent the second revolution, the revolution of 1792. So, in effect, the course of the French revolution is going to play out in miniature in Saint Domingue, with the added bonus of armed free coloreds and slave armies running around. ",
            "Okay, so let’s bring in the free colors into our web of tension. Now, as I said last week, Saint Domingue was not an explicitly racist society for the first 70 odd years of its existence. It was far less racist than British or Spanish colonies, for example. And this is one of the reasons why such a large free colored community was allowed to grow up. The Code Noir specifically granted free coloreds the same rights as anyone who had been born on native French soil, even if they themselves were freed slaves who had been born in Africa. Now, this did not make them immune to racial prejudice, and they were never assimilated into the white elite of the colony. But despite various social slights, they were able to prosper nicely. But it was this very prosperity that did finally introduce codified racism into the colony after the end of the Seven Years War in 1763. ",
            "Now, if you remember from last week, one of the defining features of the big whites is that they were seeking their colonial fortunes with the express intention of them getting out. Now, this did not apply to all of them. They were for sure rooted Creole big whites, but as prominent white families now being born in and staying in Saint Domingue. But many were taking the money and running, and many others along the way were at least making regular trips back to France, which was expensive, or spending a bunch of money on European luxury goods to make their colonial homes feel as European as possible. Well, guess who wasn’t doing any of this? The free coloreds. As the generations unfolded and free colored wealth accumulated, they tended to reinvest it in the colony, buying more land or improving their existing estates. They had no great urge to return to France, and they were far less interested in blowing money on European luxuries. And because they were staying put and their children were being born and raised in the colony and then they were staying put, the free coloreds started to naturally accumulate more power and influence inside the colony. And it’s one of the reasons newly arrived whites were happy to marry into one of these prosperous free colored families. ",
            "So this was all very troubling to the big whites who felt their political and social dominance threatened by the rising free coloreds. But no one hated the prosperous free coloreds more than the small whites. As a class, the small whites really latched onto racial superiority as the one thing they really had going for them. They did not like that their lives were so crappy, while inferior, ex slaves, barely better than animals, had it so good. And of course, the prosperous free coloreds had no love for the small whites, who were little better than slaves and who acted high and mighty without cause or justification. The free coloreds derisively referred to the small whites as negro blancs, black whites. ",
            "Meanwhile, back in the Metropole, the Colonial Office in Versailles was trying to figure out how to consolidate what was left of their overseas empire after the disastrous losses in the Seven Years War. They just had to cede Canada to the British. Specifically, they wanted to make sure they didn’t lose what they had left to, for example, native independence movements. To address this issue, they turned to a guy named Émilian Petit. Petit had written a book back in 1750 called “American Patriotism” that outlined pretty clearly the threat posed to the Metropole by an emerging Creole population in the colonies. Now, Creole just means somebody who was born in the Americas. So there were white Creoles and colored Creoles and black Creoles. And the concern was that the Creole collectively would start to create a united local interest that was in opposition to the Metropole. Petit said if the home government didn’t start making reforms, these guys are liable to try to break away from France. Being a liberal reformer, Petit said we need to treat these people not like uncivilized pirates, but like full subjects of the crown. We need to end arbitrary military rule and give them a measure of self government. We need to respect their private property rights. We need to end the Exclusive and open up the colony to free trade. That way the colonists will feel like full participants in the system rather than oppressed cogs in a tyrannical machine. ",
            "But the other key part of Petit’s reforms was to introduce a system of proto apartheid that divided the whites from the coloreds. Petit believed that if those two groups joined forces, then it would be a matter of when, not if the colony broke away from France. So one side of the coin was building up the self esteem of the white colonists by treating them better. The other was abusing and denigrating the free coloreds so that the two groups would never recognize how much their interests actually intersected. ",
            "So around about 1763, an officially racist regime started being implemented in Saint Domingue. In 1764, coloreds were forbidden from certain prominent professions: medicine, law, government jobs. In 1773, a freed slave and his or her family was forbidden to take the name of their white patriarch. This was to break the lines of inheritance and any family connections that might bind together prominent whites from their colored relatives. In 1777, blacks were barred from the Metropole completely, and free coloreds were forced to register upon arrival. In 1779, the coloreds were hit with a sumptuary law forbidding them from wearing swords in public or dressing in European style, which meant wearing the good silks. They were also forbidden from being addressed using formal titles like Madame and Senior. Manumission papers proving freedom were required for wills and marriage licenses. And, oh, by the way, there’s now a huge tack on manumission, freeing a slave, to prevent the free colored population from growing too quickly. Local notaries were ordered to keep track of racial identifiers on legal paperwork so the colonial government could start keeping a record of who was white and who was colored. After all, sometimes a colored was whiter than a white, and you never could be sure who was inferior to whom. ",
            "Before the racial identifiers, the colonists turned to the work of a guy named Moreau de Saint-Méry, who was a white Creole and who was best known for writing a massive work called ‘The Description of French Saint Domingue’, which remains a principal primary source for information on the colony before the revolution. The work was intended to guide colonial administrators, but it was unfinished by the time that the revolution swept through and made it all obsolete. Moreau de Saint-Méry had worked up a classification system that identified 128 shades of color: from the standard mulatto, which was one white parent, one black parent, though there were actually twelve different combinations that produced a mulatto, and we’re not going to worry about those. Then, in English, you have a quadroon, which is three white grandparents and one black grandparent. So, for example, Alex Dumas, the great revolutionary general, was a mulatto, while his son, Alexandre Dumas, the great novelist, was a quadroon. This system goes out to 1/128th part black, and it provided pages of tables to determine what combination makes what. ",
            "Now, in practice, a lot of this, like a lot of everything decreed by the Metropole, was just ignored. Notaries didn’t bother to note race, weddings and wills were duly approved without asking for documentation. But the official racism was odious and offensive to the prominent free coloreds, who believed themselves in every way the full equal of a white. I mean, that’s what the Code Noir had always said. And then, of course, just as these racist laws were hitting, they were landing on the first generation of coloreds who had been educated back in France. If a free colored family got enough money together, they would send their sons back to France to be educated. And back in France, at that point, racism was practically not even a thing yet. So these guys would go off, get a fully modern education, be treated as equals for a few years, and then come back to a colonial world of humiliating slights. ",
            "Now, the epicenter of the tensions between the whites, the coloreds, and the royal administrators was the issue of militia service. Service in the colonial militia was incredibly unpopular. It took time that was better spent running your property. It cost money because you had to outfit and arm yourself. And it was dangerous, for all the reasons military service is dangerous. No one liked it and reforming militia service requirements was hopefully going to be a part of the transition from military rule to enlightened civilian rule envisioned by guys like Petit. So in that pivotal year of 1763, the Metropole made a deal with the colonists: pay us a one time tax of 4 million livre, and we will abolish the militias. We’ll use regular troops to defend the colony. ",
            "This money was raised practically overnight and sent back to France, except right away, the Metropole about faced and decided it was too expensive to defend the colony with regular troops. Plus, new arrivals to the garrisons kept dying of tropical diseases the minute they stepped off the boat. So by 1764, they had backtracked and reinstated the old system. The big whites in particular went nuts about this, and they resisted all attempts to reinstate the militias. The principal court in Le Cap ran basically like a colonial parlement, and new laws had to be registered there to take effect. And resistance by the big whites in the Le Cap Council was so strong that it took five years to get the militia laws officially re-registered. And that was just the beginning of the real trouble. ",
            "After the militia laws were set to go back into effect in 1769, a full blown revolt broke out in the South Province. Prominent white Creoles got together with their free colored neighbors to resist service, going so far as to kidnap a militia captain, gathered together in the hundreds, armed and ready to fight. Now, this little rebellion was put down inside of six weeks, but it is of critical importance for two reasons. First, it was the last major uprising on the island before things started slipping inexorably towards revolution in the late 1780s. And second, it was the last time that big whites and free coloreds joined forces to fight a common cause. Despite the fact that their natural economic interests aligned, they would henceforth be on opposite sides of all future political confrontations. It would not be until far too late that the big whites realized, “Hey, those guys are actually slave owning planters just like me. And skin color aside, we have a ton in common. Maybe we should…” But by then, it would be too late. ",
            "The upshot of all this is that the big whites were basically exempted from military service completely by the 1770s, and the free coloreds wound up being the backbone of the local military. They were required to serve three years in the police force tasked with tracking down runaway slaves, and after that, they would graduate to the militia, which they could not exempt themselves from in ways that whites could. ",
            "Now, the coloreds did not like militias service either, and they were really unhappy about the new racist laws that barred them from serving as officers. But militia service was a visible way of demonstrating that they were ready and able to be full contributing citizens of the colony. So they endured their service with grudging obedience and as a part of this visible display of patriotic loyalty, when volunteers were called for in 1779 to go off and fight in the American War of Independence, almost no local whites joined. But 941 free coloreds showed up to enlist, and ultimately, 545 sailed off with the French army. And then they served with distinction in the siege of Savannah, which I mentioned back in episode 2.10: Turning South. ",
            "Just as the end of the Seven Years War changed colonial policy, the end of the American War of Independence changed it again. With the colony once again booming in the aftermath of wartime recessions, and with the white planters and merchants in the North American colonies having successfully broken away from the British empire, the French royal authorities started seeing the coloreds as potential allies rather than enemies. Though the existing racist laws were not repealed, the spread of the apartheid was arrested after 1783. With the big whites in North America having thrown off the British, the royal authorities decided that maybe the free coloreds could be a bulwark against a similar revolt in Saint Domingue. ",
            "Aside from dividing whites from coloreds, one of the other stated goals of all the racist laws in the 1760s and 1770s was to stop the contagion of liberty from slipping over to the slaves. The whites were deathly afraid that once they started treating freed slaves like full members of society, it wouldn’t take long before an enslaved slave started saying, “Hey, there’s no difference between him and me but a piece of paper.” But this was never actually much of a threat. The free coloreds and the black slaves did not really identify with each other at all. Prominent free coloreds, no different than the big whites, treated slaves as property to be used and discarded. And slaves knew damn well that the free coloreds were not their brothers, they were just another class of master. ",
            "So that brings us to the slaves, because in Saint Domingue, the mother of all tensions, the tension at the center of the web of tension was between master and slave. The singular fear of the free population was a slave revolt. In total, slaves outnumbered the free population ten to one, and then out on the individual plantations, this could run much, much higher, with just a few overseers surrounded by black slaves. And though masters ran the gamut from generous to sadistic, there was a common belief that the only way to make sure that the slaves didn’t rise up was to keep them in constant terror. ",
            "In Saint Domingue, exemplary torture was the order of the day, and the masters were creative and unrelenting. Aside from standard cracks of the whip out in the field, lashing was the most common form of punishment. And there were different types with cute little names. There was ‘the forepost’, which was laying the victim face down on the ground and tying out their hands and feet. Then there was ‘the ladder’, which was hanging them from a ladder before whipping them. Then there was ‘the hammock’, which was hog-tying them to the limb of a tree. The lashes would be delivered by the slave drivers, and the number varied with the crime. But one astute planter advised that the number of lashes was less important than the length of time the lashing went on. Fewer lashes delivered over a longer period of time was more agonizing and thus more instructive to everyone than a bunch of lashes issued quickly. Either way, during a severe session, it was not uncommon for the victim to simply be whipped to death. Their body would be discarded, and a new slave would have to be purchased. ",
            "Aside from whipping, there were all manner of more permanent punishments. Heavy irons tied to the feet or hands or hung around the neck. Blocks of wood chained to the body to be worn around at all times. Iron face masks to stop slaves from eating the sugar cane. As we discussed last time, regular work duties often led to accidental mutilation. Well, intentional mutilation was also a standard punishment for theft or for running away. Hacking off of hands, feet and ears was pretty standard. Genitals could also be destroyed in certain circumstances, and often this was done with hot wax or boiling sugar. And to make matters worse, masters would rub open wounds with salt and pepper or hot ashes to jack up the misery. Full on executions were also designed to be creative and horrible. There are accounts of slaves being buried up to their necks, their faces slathered with sugar for the bugs to come eat them alive. And then there are particularly gruesome stories about tying slaves up, stuffing their anus with gunpowder, and blowing them up. It was called ‘putting a little powder up the arse of a Negro’. The point of all this was to terrorize the slaves into believing that there was no hope and that the slightest misstep meant torture and death. ",
            "But despite all this terror, slaves did resist in what small ways they could. On the most basic level of daily work, slaves might intentionally work slowly, sabotage machinery or break tools. They often acted dumb or unable to comprehend anything without explicit instructions and constant oversight. Descriptions of slaves as naturally stupid and lazy were universal and probably reflected nothing so much as why on earth should I be smart and hardworking? Bleep, you bleep hole. ",
            "A step above intentionally jamming up the works was running away. In Saint Domingue, this was called marronage, and runaways were called maroons. And there are two basic types of marronage: petit marronage and grand marronage. So again with the little and big, so it’s better to distinguish them as temporary and permanent. Temporary marronage was often a deliberate strike tactic to force changes or extract slightly better treatment from the masters. Occasionally, there would be mass walkouts, protesting a particularly bad manager or overseer. And as often as not, a negotiated settlement would be reached, and the slaves would return with a promise that the runaways would not be punished. While gone, the runaways might simply lurk on the outskirts of the plantation and might even sleep in their own beds at night. But if you got caught without having negotiated your return, please refer to the horrible punishments that I just described. ",
            "Permanent marronage, on the other hand, was an attempt to flee slavery altogether, and it took two basic forms. First, a slave might make it to one of the bigger cities, where they would pass themselves off as a free black laborer. Forged manumission papers were available on the black market. Women runaways would generally seek employment in a brothel, and if they were incredibly lucky, they might make the transition from prostitute to mistress to wife. Now, this was all doable, but with every slave bearing a brand and with wanted fugitive notices constantly making the rounds with quite specific descriptions of the runaway, this was not very easy to pull off. If the permanent runaway didn’t make for one of the cities, they headed in the opposite direction, up into the unpopulated mountains along the border between French Saint Domingue and Spanish Santo Domingo. For the whole history of the colony, there were always free maroon communities living up in the mountains. In 1720, for example, there was a mass breakout of about 1,000 slaves who formed one of the largest communities on record. Usually, they numbered 100 or fewer. These guys would survive by a combination of living off the land, raiding nearby plantations, or trading with the Spanish side of the island. By the middle of the 1700s, there was an estimated 3,000 maroons living out in these communities. And despite the efforts of the militias and the runaway slave police, they would never be eliminated. And completely eliminating the maroons wasn’t even in the master’s best interest. It was better for the truly rebellious slaves who could not be controlled, to find an escape hatch out the back door, then feeling trapped and then forced into violent resistance. ",
            "Now, the deadliest form of resistance and the one most feared by the masters, was poison. If a slave had some basic knowledge about herbs, they could concoct a poison. And because they handled all the food and water, murdering a household would be a snap. Or at least that’s what the owners believed. People and livestock dropped dead in Saint Domingue all the time, and separating the times, it was just regular old disease, from the times where it was deliberate poisoning was practically impossible. But the owners were really really super paranoid about being poisoned by their slaves. ",
            "Now, compared to other Caribbean colonies, there was not much in the way of organized slave rebellions prior to the spectacular revolt of August 1791. But there was one famous failed uprising in the late 1750s that stood at the intersection of marronage and poison. An African born slave named Mackandal started gaining a reputation for himself in the slave communities as a great orator and leader. He mixed magical elements of various religions and presented himself as a slave prophet. Eventually, he ran away and became the leader of a Maroon community. He then spent upwards of six years building an organization with members in all the plantations, in cities, and at all levels of the slave hierarchy. There was a chain of command and a plan, and any fellow slave who learned of the brewing conspiracy and did not join it would be ruthlessly killed. Mackandal’s plan was ambitious. He was going to poison every well in Le Cap, and then when the population was decimated by tainted water, he would lead his armed followers into the city for a general massacre and the overthrow of the French slavers. ",
            "But just before the plot was about to be executed in January 1758, Mackandal was betrayed to the authorities and captured. He was tortured and then burned alive. But having sworn to his followers that he could change shape, the myth emerged that Mackandal, in fact, turned himself into a fly and floated away before the flames got him. And the legend of Mackandal, I mean, who knows the actual extent or aim of the conspiracy, lived on in both the imaginations of the master and the slave. The former terrified it might happen again, the latter cherishing it as a dream that might one day yet be realized. ",
            "As the slaves dreamed of maybe one day overthrowing the system from the inside, another group on the other side of the world dreamed of dismantling it from the outside. And this will bring us back full circle to the tension between the big white masters and the powers that be back in France, who started possibly coming under the sway of a dreaded new intellectual movement: abolitionism. The idea that human beings should not be held as property got going with the Enlightenment. And in France, there were two particular works that really took root. The first was a book called “The Year 2440” by Louis-Sébastien Mercier, which is an original Rip van Winkle story with the author waking up in the far future and exploring the new fantastic world he discovers. The important bit for us in this work of utopian science fiction comes when the time traveling author comes across a statue in honor of the man who led the colonial slaves to freedom. It was a statue dedicated to the Avenger of the New World. This theme was then picked up by the enlightened clergyman, Abbe Raynal, in his work “The Philosophical and Political History of the Establishment and Commerce of the Europeans and the Two Indies”, which was nearly continuously in print after its first publication in 1770. The work was a general survey of colonial history and economics, but it contained scathing passages denouncing slavery and promising that if the system was not dismantled slowly, it would eventually explode violently. ",
            "After the end of the American War of Independence led to the massive influx of new slaves into Saint Domingue (as we said last week, imports jumped to nearly 40,000 a year), the colonial authorities decided to take measures to curb the worst abuses of slavery and start possibly enforcing the provisions of the Code Noir. So in December 1784, and then again in December 1785, the Colonial Office issued decrees on the treatment of slaves. Owners were to keep compliance records of the provisions, clothes and food they provided their slaves. There were now to be maximum limits on the amount of hours a slave could work in the day, and they were also supposed to get Sunday afternoon off, too. Slaves were also to be protected if they justly complained about mistreatment. Without the slightest hint of irony, the colonial masters were incredulous and denounced the despotism of the Metropole. Mostly, though, they said, if you get between us and our slaves, you’ll be the one fermenting slave insurrection, not us, because they’ll start thinking they have rights, and that will be the ballgame. In an almost exact replay of what was about to go on back in France, the Le Cap Council refused to register the edicts. And in 1787, the exasperated intendant had had enough. He abolished the Le Cap Council and moved its functions down to Port-au-Prince. This all happened one year before the great battles over the closure of the Parlements rocked France in 1788. That soon led to the Day of the Tiles. ",
            "Now, in fact, in 1788, all of this tension came to a near head when a paranoid master named Le Jeune suspected some of his slaves of trying to poison him. He tortured two suspected women and then chained them to a wall to die. Under the new rules, 14 slaves presented themselves to the royal officials, described the crimes that had taken place, and then the officials opened up an inquiry against Le Jeune. After the alleged box of poison was found to contain nothing but tobacco, they were set to prosecute him for murder. So this is going to be a major test of these new slave laws. But as the prosecution progressed, the big whites rallied behind Le Jeune. They provided testimony of their own that contradicted the slaves account. And they hinted darkly that if he wasn’t acquitted, the royal governor would soon have a revolt on his hands. Le Jeune was duly acquitted. The big whites had flexed their muscle, cowed the local officials into backing down and kept firm control over their slaves. ",
            "So this all brings us right up to the edge of the French Revolution. And next week, the Metropole will be rocked by the events of 1789. Everyone in Saint Domingue was going to try to take advantage of the crisis. The big whites will send representatives back to France to make sure that their rights were protected and maybe even expanded. The free coloreds will send their own representatives back to lobby for full political and social equality. And while no one was there representing the slaves, they too recognized the possibilities opened up by the revolution. In the midst of Abbe Raynal’s denunciation of slavery in The History of the Two Indies, he wrote, “A courageous chief only is wanted. Where is he? That great man whom nature owes to her vexed, oppressed and tormented children, where is he? He will appear, doubt it not. He will come forth and raise the sacred standard of liberty.” And Raynal was right. That man is coming.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So last week, we approached the brink of the French Revolution and discussed the tensions that would shape the course of events inside Saint Domingue once things started going nuts back in the Metropole. But in this early phase of the revolution, events in the colony would not be defined by the great tension between master and slave, but rather the tension between the whites and the free coloreds over what it meant to be a citizen. As the great writer, historian and general man of letters C.L.R. James put it in his seminal work, “The Black Jacobins”, it was the conflict between the whites and the coloreds that, quote, woke the sleeping slaves. So to understand how the French Revolution affected the colony of Saint Domingue, we should probably do some quick background on this great moment in the history of Western civilization. What was the French Revolution? Why did it break out? What was at stake? Who were its leaders? ",
            "Just kidding. ",
            "Though Saint Domingue’s principal port city of Le Cap was always about two months behind on the news, that news did come in daily and in detail. So through the late 1780s, the colonists were well informed about the monarchy’s financial troubles and the movement to convene the Estates General. And indeed, the big whites, in particular, were very well connected because the maritime bourgeoisie, the guys making a fortune in the colonial trade, were some of the principal players of that movement to convene the Estates General. But though they were economically linked and in constant contact, that did not mean the maritime bourgeoisie back in the Metropole and the big whites of Saint Domingue saw eye to eye. The big whites wanted free trade. The maritime bourgeoisie wanted to maintain the Exclusive. The big whites wanted self government. The maritime bourgeoisie wanted to make sure that the Metropole maintained control of colonial policy. But one thing they absolutely agreed on was that the slave plantation system had to be maintained at all costs. And with every idealist and their mother coming out of the woodwork preaching liberty and equality, the slave issue was going to become an issue. ",
            "When the king formally called for the Estates General to meet, these idealists did indeed start coming out of the woodwork. Mostly drawn from the ranks of the liberal nobility, they coalesced around our old friend Jacques Pierre Brissot. Not yet the war mongering de facto leader of the Girondin faction, Brissot was still at this point an idealistic journalist who was an early adopter of abolitionism following his residency in England and tour of the United States. In 1788, he formed a club called the Society of the Friends of the Blacks that soon had a number of very prominent members, including the Marquis de Condorcet, who had already published an article calling for an end to slavery in 1781; the hero of two worlds, the Marquis de Lafayette; and then the coming great orator of the revolution, the Comte de Mirabeau. Of particular importance for today’s episode was a liberal Catholic priest named Henri Grégoire, usually referred to as the Abbe Grégoire. A passionate and committed liberal theologian, Grégoire’s principal hobby horse prior to the revolution was lobbying on behalf of the Jews. But it would soon become apparent to him that anything he said on behalf of the Jews also applied to the free coloreds of Saint Domingue, and he would become their principal ally inside the National Assembly. ",
            "As the primary electoral assembly started to gather in early 1789, the Friends of the Blacks lobbied to have the issue of slavery inserted onto the various grievance lists. But for the moment, everyone had far more immediate problems than the plight of African slaves on the other side of the world. And all the campaign really accomplished was convincing colonial interests to be on hyper alert for anything that smacked of abolitionism. ",
            "Back in Saint Domingue, the big whites started holding secret and unauthorized meetings in mid-1788 to discuss how to take advantage of the political situation back in the Metropole. These Provisional Assemblies met in all three provinces, but restricted themselves to white property holders, excluding both the small whites and the free coloreds. The first thing on the agenda was: Do we try to get into the Estates General, or do we stay out of it? ",
            "If the ultimate goal was colonial self government, sending delegates might tacitly acknowledge the right of the Metropole to govern our internal affairs. But the benefits of having a voice seemed to outweigh the drawbacks, and in late 1788, the Provisional Assemblies elected a slate of colonial delegates and then drew up their own grievance list to present to the Estates General. These lists included an end to military rule, the establishment of civilian justice, the right to vote on internal legislation and taxes that would only be subject to the will of the King, and a colonial committee in Versailles who would be elected by us, the colonists. They also explicitly opposed any dismantling of the racial laws which they saw as essential to maintaining the insanely lucrative slave plantation system. ",
            "When these delegates arrived in France, they got together with absentee owners in Paris and formed a political club called the Club Massiac to lobby for their interests. And the most important member of this new club was Moreau de Saint-Méry. As France’s leading authority on the Caribbean colonies, Moreau de Saint-Méry was back in Paris doing research for his massive description of the colony. And by joining the Club Massiac, he lent his considerable reputation and authority to the cause of the big whites. When the Estates-General met in May 1789, the would-be colonial delegates presented themselves uninvited and set about lobbying for inclusion in the Third Estate. But of course, things spiraled out of control on day two of the Estates General, and before you know it, the door to the Third Estate meeting hall was being locked and everyone’s booking it down to the tennis court to pose for Jacques-Louis David’s great painting. Although they were not yet technically members of the Assembly, the wouldbe colonial delegates followed them, got into the tennis court and took the oath along with everyone else. Since these colonial representatives were in many cases drawn from the ranks of the nobility, their solidarity during this crisis endeared them to the Third Estate delegates. And when the three Estates truly merged into the National Assembly at the end of June 1789, the colonial petition for seats was taken up. ",
            "But the colonials had not endeared themselves to all the delegates, certainly not any of the Friends of the Blacks. Mirabeau in particular, wasn’t going to let these guys in without blasting them with both barrels. When the colonists ask for 18 seats, which was about the right number based on their total population, Mirabeau thundered in a famous speech:",
            "“You claim representation proportionate to the number of the inhabitants. The free blacks are proprietors and taxpayers, and yet they have not been allowed to vote. And as for the slaves, either they are men or they are not. If the colonists consider them to be men, let them free then and make them electors and eligible for seats. If the contrary is the case, have we, in apportioning deputies according to the population of France, taking into consideration the number of our horses and our mules?” ",
            "It was an uncomfortable line of attack for everyone, especially for the 150 odd National Assembly delegates who had direct economic interest in the colonies. On the one hand, ‘we’re here to defend our rights and our liberties’, but on the other hand, ‘I don’t want my cash cow to stop pumping out sugar’. On July 4, 1789, the assembly compromised and Saint Domingue was granted six seats, two for each province, all of them big whites. ",
            "Mirabeau’s attack on the exclusion of the free coloreds in particular was not merely abstract, because as the big whites were lobbying for inclusion, the National Assembly was also being lobbied by a small clique of free coloreds who were absolutely chomping at the bit to put their right to full quality front and center. In fact, one of their principal leaders had been in France since 1784, lobbying the royal officials to repeal the racist laws of Saint Domingue. And this man’s name was Julien Raimond. ",
            "Julien Raimond was the quintessential, prosperous freeman of color, born in 1744 in Saint Domingue, South Province. His mother, Marie, was a free mulatto. That is, her father was a white indigo planter, and her mother was a freed black slave. Raimond’s father, Pierre, meanwhile, was the quintessential recent white immigrant, looking to immediately better his position by marrying into a prosperous mixed family. Marie was both better educated and held considerably more property than the illiterate Pierre, and he was really marrying up when he won her hand. The marriage produced five sons and three daughters, all of whom would be soon classified quadroon, that is, three white grandparents and one black grandparent. The family was prosperous enough that Julien was sent back to receive an education in France, probably just after the end of the Seven Years War. And when he returned to Saint Domingue 1766 as an ambitious 22 year old with a fully modern education, he discovered that life for the coloreds was changing rapidly for the worse, and he was not happy about it. ",
            "But still, the Raimonds did very well for themselves down in the South Province. The family specialty, pioneered by Pierre and Marie, was to buy rundown plantations abandoned by failed or dead whites, fix them up, and add them to the family’s little indigo empire. But this meant that the Raimonds were also the type of colored family most offended by the Metropole’s decision to implement a racist social and political structure. They were one of the most prosperous families in the South Province, period. So why is our race now being marked down on legal forms? Why does it matter? Why do we constantly have to prove that we are actually free when we want to marry or bequeath our private property? Why do whites now lurk outside of church services and weddings, looking to catch us wearing clothes and jewelry that is now, for some reason, illegal for us to wear? This whole racist apparatus is immoral, obnoxious and counterproductive. ",
            "By 1784, Julien Raimond was done. He left his family and property behind and sailed to France with the single goal of convincing the colonial administrators that they were making a bad mistake. Over the next two years, he submitted four lengthy memos that outlined just how beneficial the coloreds were to colonial productivity. And in keeping with the neoclassical times, he sprinkled his work with allusions to Roman virtue. The coloreds were industrious and hardworking and imbued with a special moral rectitude. He also harped on the benefits of a single rule of law for all subjects of the King, playing right into the current debates about the mishmash legal codes that jammed up French law. But most especially, Raimond swore that the big white argument that separating out the coloreds would ensure the survival of the slave plantation system had it backwards. If you want the profits of your slave empire to keep coming in, you need to treat colored masters like me the same as the white masters. And Raimond himself owned over 100 slaves. The response from the colonial officials was welcoming but noncommittal. As I mentioned last week, racial apartheid was not extended further during the 1780s, and that was probably due in part to Raimond’s influence. But the outright repeal of racism he was seeking did not come. Influential whites back in the colony were happy to contradict Raimond’s reports and tell the Metropole that the coloreds are fine. It’s not as bad as he says. Everything is fine. ",
            "But Raimond was not the only prominent free colored back in France, and he was joined by one of the wealthiest, if not the wealthiest, free colored man in the colony: Vincent Ogé. Ogé was born free and had invested profits from his career as a merchant and plantation manager in the North Province into property and plantations of his own. And just like Julien Raimond, he hated the entrenching racism. But Ogé himself commanded quite a bit of personal respect in Le Cap, and he was one of those guys that the letter of various race laws did not really apply to, and whites tended to treat him as an equal. ",
            "So both Raimond and Ogé were still in France when the big revolutionary boulder got rolling down the hill in 1789. Both were in constant correspondence with their free colored brethren back in the colony, and they knew that the big whites had engineered secret delegate elections that excluded the coloreds. In March 1789, Raimond formally petitioned the Royal Ministry for free colored seats in the Estates General. But the Ministry ignored the petition until after the Estates General had convened, whereupon they said no. But by then, events had taken on a life of their own. ",
            "Ten days after the big whites had won their seats in the National Assembly on July 4, 1789, the Bastille fell. But the fall of the Bastille was not nearly as big of a deal for the free coloreds in Paris as what happened in August 1789. First, there was the delirious night of August 4, which saw the National Assembly renounce feudalism and all obsolete rules that put some men over other men. Free colored ears perked up because what was colonial racism but the aristocracy of the skin?",
            "In the midst of that night, one of the Friends of the Blacks got up, the Duke de La Rochefoucauld and proposed abolishing slavery along with everything else, but the motion was studiously ignored. A few weeks later, on August 26, Raimond appeared before the Club Massiac to request their support for free colored representation to, in effect, create a unified colonial lobby of property holders. But the Club rejected the offer, hoping to maintain white supremacy. But of course, on that very same day, the National Assembly unleashed what was sure to be a lethal cannon blast to the guts of racial apartheid when they almost unanimously adopted Lafayette’s Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, which began so so unequivocally “Men are born and remain free and equal in rights”. This was then hopefully followed by another thundering speech from Mirabeau in which he said “There are not and cannot be, either in France or in any other country under French laws, any other men than free men, men equal to one another”. ",
            "The implications of the Declaration of the Rights of Man were obviously enormous for both the free coloreds and for the slaves. But like I said, a good 10% of the National Assembly delegates were directly tied to the colonial trade, and most of the rest understood that in a kingdom facing a massive financial crisis, you don’t mess with the one clear moneymaking operation going and that was slave manufactured sugar and coffee. If the Declaration of Rights was really as universal as they were making it sound, they were going to destroy slavery. Forced to rule on whether the declaration applied in the colonies, the National Assembly courageously set the matter aside for a later date. ",
            "But Raimond and Ogé and the other free coloreds could see no way that the Declaration of Rights would not apply to them. So, rejected by the Club Massiac, the free coloreds in Paris created their own club, the Society of American Colonists, to press for inclusion in the National Assembly to defend what were now clearly their rights as citizens. ",
            "Meanwhile, back in those American colonies, news of the Bastille finally arrived in September 1789 to general rejoicing amongst the white colonists. The big whites could practically taste independence, while the small whites believed that their lot was about to improve dramatically in any new order. And among those small whites was a healthy contingent of recently arrived immigrants from the Metropole. Remember that the recent harvest in France had been awful, especially that winter of 1788-1789, and hopeless men had emigrated to the colonies looking for salvation. When word of the Bastille hit, the colonial whites immediately followed the lead of their countrymen back in the Metropole. The once hated militias were recast as National Guard companies and patriotic whites eagerly joined up. The revolutionary cockade was now supported proudly, and the Provisional Assemblies that had elected delegates to the Estates General came out fully into the light and started asserting a self proclaimed sovereignty. ",
            "Opposed to the revolution in Saint Domingue were, of course, the royal officials, led by the Governor General and the intendant, whose authority was now everywhere being sneered at, and also the free coloreds. For them, the revolution looked like it would mean the final triumph of white supremacy in the colony. The big whites made no secret that self government meant white government, and the small whites were openly salivating over the prospect of confiscating and redistributing free colored property amongst themselves. So, where once royal officials had been able to exploit the tension between the big and small whites, the revolution now made them a solid, patriotic block. So the royal officials started to look at the free coloreds. But in October, the intendant had to flee the island, probably one step ahead of a good old fashioned lynching.",
            "Right around the same time, October 1789, the first word of the Declaration of the Rights of Man arrived, which threatened to upend not just white supremacy, but the institution of slavery. The response by the patriotic whites was swift and decisive: they outright banned the circulation of newspapers from France to prevent the spread of this incredibly dangerous idea. I mean, my God, what if the slaves found out? But you couldn’t keep a secret in Saint Domingue. Slaves working the docks talked to slaves driving the wagons talked to slaves on the plantations. Julien Raimond’s brother wrote back to him and said that at least some of their slaves knew that the blue, white and red cockades that the whites now proudly wore meant liberty and equality. Uh oh! ",
            "The whites and Saint Domingue were also not above using murderous force to stop the spread of the idea that men are born and remain free and equal in rights. In November, a group of free coloreds in the South Province petitioned local white leaders to abolish the race laws, now that the Declaration of Rights had been proclaimed. Not only did the whites refuse, but after they determined a prominent white lawyer had helped the coverage draw up the petition, a gang of small whites tracked down the lawyer and lynched him in fine patriotic fashion. ",
            "By that point, though, the revolution back in France had already hit its next major turning point when the women came and dragged the royal family back to Paris. Having failed to get the Club Massiac to join them, the Society of American Colonists turned to the Friends of the Blacks to support their continued bid for representation in the National Assembly. Raimond did not want abolition at all, but he was not above exploiting liberal idealism to his own advantage. He said, if you want to tear down slavery, you need to start by establishing the equality of the free coloreds. The best way to help your cause is to first help mine. The Friends of the Blacks agreed to this strategy and the next 18 months were defined not by arguments about slavery, but by arguments about the free coloreds. ",
            "On October 22, 1789, a small delegation representing the free colors were allowed to make their case to the National Assembly, who said that they would always hear petitions from their citizens, which was a good sign. This delegation included Raimond, Ogé and a white lawyer who actually presented their case. The delegation made the virtually unassailable argument that the Declaration of the Rights of man absolutely 100% had to apply to them. How could it not? But they also made a rather blunt appeal to the nation’s pocketbook. To demonstrate their patriotism, the free coloreds of Saint Domingue pledged 6 million livres to the nation. For an assembly convened specifically to address a financial crisis, this was no small thing. Then they left it to the National Assembly to decide. And wouldn’t you know it, the Abbe Grégoire was chair of the Credentials Committee. Grégoire forced through approval of the Colored Petition, but when it hit the full assembly, he was shouted down. There was widespread fear that free colored rights were the first step to dismantling slavery, and it didn’t help that that’s pretty much the argument Grégoire himself was making. The National Assembly again courageously refused to make a final decision, and the coloreds were forced back into political limbo. ",
            "It was not until March 1790 that the National Assembly finally got around to making some decisions about colonial policy. The principal issue at stake was whether the new Constitution of France would apply in the colonies. A Colonial Committee was created to make recommendations and, wouldn’t you know it, this committee was dominated by either men holding colonial property or men with a vested interest in maritime trade. So you just know where this is headed. The Committee president was none other than our old friend Antoine Barnave, he of the Feuillant triumvirate, and he was in the bag, most especially for the maritime bourgeoisie. The Colonial Committee concluded that the colonies would not, repeat, not be governed by the Constitution of France. Instead, they would have their own assemblies who would pass laws that govern their internal affairs. But that said, Barnave and the Colonial Committee critically defined trade policy as an external affair to be administered by the Metropole. The Committee also said that elections to the new Colonial Assembly would follow the active passive citizen distinction, so electors had to be property owning men over the age of 25. When this was presented to the full National Assembly, the Abbe Grégoire said, “Well, clearly that means that property owning free coloreds qualify, and I’d like you to please state that specifically so there’s no misunderstanding.” But again, he was shouted down. What the delegates wanted was do not face the race question, please. So it’s fine how it’s written. Let’s move on. ",
            "Meanwhile, back in the colony, things were progressing in fine revolutionary fashion. In January 1790, Saint Domingue received permission from the Royal Ministry to elect a colony-wide assembly. The whites of Saint Domingue took this to mean that self government was on the way. In February, the Provisional Assemblies commenced with elections. But without any guidance yet from the National Assembly, voting was thrown open to all whites over the age of 25 who had resided in the colony for more than one year. This meant that the small whites were now in, while the free coloreds were out. The big whites had decided to throw their lot in with the poor whites rather than the property coloreds. And it was a decision that many would soon regret. ",
            "Now, I have seen this new elected body called both the General Assembly, which is, I believe, what the colonists themselves called it, but also the Colonial Assembly, which is what everyone else, including practically every book I’ve read on the subject, calls it. So I am going to call it the Colonial Assembly. ",
            "This assembly convened in April 1790 in the city of Saint-Marc, which was in the West Province and roughly equidistant from Le Cap and Port-au-Prince. The point of meeting in Saint-Marc was that it removed the assembly from any threat posed by the main royal army garrisons, which were located in Le Cap and Port-au-Prince. The delegates numbered about 200. And as we’ve seen in assemblies like this in previous revolutions, it was the most committed and passionate who were willing to invest time in serving in the assembly, and so the Colonial Assembly wound up being pretty bold and self confident. Some arrived cautioning against sending signals that they were aiming for independence, but the majority brushed off those concerns. They started drafting a constitution claiming the right to full self government and then provocatively started voting down all the restrictions in the Exclusive one by one. But the aggressive antics of the Colonial Assembly led to friction within the white community. The Provisional Assembly of the north continued to sit after its more radical members had gone off to the Colonial Assembly. And so those that remained behind skewed more conservative. Many of them were traders, merchants and lawyers with deep ties to the merchant houses back in France. If the Colonial Assembly started running too far too fast, their business interests might be put in jeopardy. So over April and May 1790, there actually opened up a little three way conflict amongst the whites in the colony: the uber patriot Colonial Assembly in Saint-Marc, the more conservative North Province Provisional Assembly, and then the remaining royal bureaucrats still trying to maintain a semblance of authority. ",
            "Now, at almost the same moment that the Colonial Assembly completed its final draft of Saint Domingue’s new constitution, in May 1790, the National Assembly’s colonial decrees arrived. Self government for men of property trade policy dictated by the Metropole. The Colonial Assembly was outraged, especially the language about who counted as a citizen. The small white delegates were not about to be disenfranchised in favor of the coloreds, who they called a bastard and degenerate race. And then everyone took issue with the Metropole claim to sovereignty over trade and said, “Yeah, we don’t think so. In fact, guess what? Saint Domingue’s ports are now open to free trade with everyone.” ",
            "This was all finally too much for the Royal Governor. And for the first time in forever, he actually had support from a number of big whites, who had concluded that the Colonial Assembly was an embarrassment. Already, more than half its members had started resigning or slipping away. When the remaining hundred odd delegates tried to brazenly blow off the home government, the Royal Governor ordered troops to march north from Port-au-Prince to disperse the assembly. At the same time, troops and militiamen from Le Cap marched south to support the action. When the troops closed in on Saint-Marc, the assembly delegates knew that they had to make a run for it. But to where? The answer, much to everyone’s surprise, turned out to be anchored in Saint-Marc’s Harbor. The crew of a small warship called the Leopard mutinied against their captain in support of the Colonial Assembly. 85 of the assembly delegates hurried on board the Leopard and the ship immediately sailed for France, where the delegates planned to protest the tyranny of the Royal Governor. ",
            "After their voyage across the Atlantic and then from the coast to Paris, the Leopardins, as they became known, were granted an audience with Barnave in the Colonial Committee in October 1790. But instead of feeling the revolutionary love, the Leopardins were bawled out for their borderline treason, and the actions of the Colonial Assembly were denounced. But that said, the 85 men were allowed to stay on in Paris, where they all joined the Club Massiac to help steer colonial policy in the direction they envisioned: de facto independence and white supremacy. ",
            "In that same October of 1790, while the white Leopardins were getting yelled at, a free colored revolt broke out back in Saint Domingue. And it was this revolt, this ultimately failed revolt, that would set the stage for full blown revolution, which will break out in the summer of 1791. This all important free colored revolt was led by none other than Vincent Ogé. Unlike Raimond, Ogé had lost patience with the political tap dancing of the National Assembly. When the colonial decrees of March 1790 finally came, Ogé became convinced of two things: ",
            "First, the wording absolutely granted full citizenship to him and his property brethren. Over 25? Check. Property? Check. What else do you need? ",
            "Second, the whites are going to conspire to exclude us, and no one is going to fight for the rights of the free coloreds, but the free coloreds themselves. ",
            "So, in July 1790, Ogé quietly slipped out of France, heading first for London, where he met with the famed abolitionist Thomas Clarkson, who pledged money and credit for Ogé’s operation. Then Ogé possibly sailed to the United States, where he would purchase arms, and from there down the Atlantic coast, landing in the North Province, again in secret, in October 1790. Ogé passed through Le Cap up to the mountain fringes that border the Northern Plains, where he planted a proverbial flag and started calling for supporters to rally to his cause. He immediately attracted a couple of hundred men, but that would be it. Ogé launched his bid for colored equality in the middle of a driving rainstorm, which killed any attempt to concentrate a force, and, of course, Saint Domingue’s terrain made linking up free colored insurgents in the North, West and South Provinces nearly impossible anyway. ",
            "Ogé made it very clear and communiques to the Provisional Assembly in Le Cap that this show of armed defiance was about securing for the coloreds to the rights that they had been explicitly granted by the National Assembly, that this was not about freeing the slaves. But he also intimated that should the whites persist in their racism, he might be forced to arm the slaves to help him win. It was this threat, more than anything else that got the whites out of bed. The Le Cap National Guard mustered and advanced on Ogé’s position. Outmanned and outgunned, this little colored insurgency was scattered after a brief skirmish. Ogé himself and a few of his followers fled across the border into Santo Domingo. But they were picked up by the Spanish authorities and extradited back to Saint Domingue. He was held in captivity for three months while he and the other captured participants were prosecuted. In February 1791, Ogé was sentenced to death. But not just death. He was broken on the wheel and then beheaded. ",
            "The execution of Ogé set off a firestorm on both sides of the Atlantic. Inside Saint Domingue, the free coloreds took it as proof that there could be no justice for them unless they fought for it. Throughout the colony, colored families started to arm themselves and organize themselves. If open war did break out, they were not going to go down without a fight. Meanwhile, the insurrection itself convinced the whites that the coloreds were just as dangerous as they had always suspected, and that the next thing you know, they’re going to be arming the slaves to come massacre us all. And though that had never been a tool anyone had previously wanted to use, Ogé’s threat to arm the slaves planted a dangerous seed in everyone’s head, and soon enough, they would all be enlisting the slaves to fight their battles. ",
            "The reaction back in Paris, meanwhile, would have even greater consequences. The Society of American Colonists and their allies and the Friends of the Black had been on the defensive for a year now and were able to finally retake the high ground. They denounced the barbarous murder of a wealthy, prominent and well respected citizen who had done nothing but fight for the rights that had been granted to him both by God and the national assembly, and for the crime of fighting for this liberty, he had been tortured to death. The Ogé incident reopened colonial policy, and in May 1791, the National Assembly began its longest, deepest, and most contentious debate on the issue. ",
            "Speaking on behalf of the white colonial, interest during this debate was Moreau de Saint-Méry. He argued that it was pointless to try to use the Ogé affair to reopen the debate, because it was now absolutely settled that matters of race and slavery in the colonies were internal matters to the colonies. If the National Assembly took this moment to renege on that deal, it would be catastrophic for relations between France and her colonies. In response to this, a relatively obscure delegate named Maximilien Robespierre stood up and famously said, ",
            "“You urge without ceasing the rights of man, but you believe in them so little yourself that you have sanctified slavery constitutionally. The supreme interest of the nation and of the colonies is that you remain free and that you do not overturn with your own hands the foundations of liberty. Perish the colonies if the price is to be your happiness, your glory, your liberty.” ",
            "And this last line is usually more famously reported as “perish the colonies” rather than a principle. Julien Raimond was then allowed to make a speech in defense of colored rights, but he took a different tact, saying bluntly that the National Assembly must recognize colored citizenship if they hope to keep the slaves enslaved. ",
            "As is often the case with these things, the final conclusion to this weeklong debate enraged everybody. The delegates agreed that literally putting the word ‘slavery’ in the constitution didn’t look too good, and so they changed it to ‘unfree persons’. Critics of Robespierre contend that it was only the word ‘slavery’ he was objecting to anyway, and so this was actually a win for him. Supporters of Robespierre, meanwhile, contend that he was after far far more, but he had to unhappily settle for this meaningless rewording. Now, this was all going in favor of Moreau de Saint-Méry and the Club Massiac. But then, at the very last minute, the National Assembly was stricken with a conscience. How could they so adamantly demand the Declaration of the Rights of Man be the preamble to their constitution, while leaving free men of color to their fates? ",
            "So just before the vote was taken, Jean-François Reubell, the future director, offered an amendment: Any free colored worn to two free parents was a citizen, full stop. This amendment passed overwhelmingly, and three commissioners were selected to go to Saint Domingue and ensure its implementation. And suddenly, there it was. The gauntlet had been thrown down. ",
            "Now, the Reubell amendment only affected a few hundred free coloreds. Freed slaves continued to form the bulk of free colored mothers. But this was still a major blow against the idea that race per se had anything to do with citizenship. ",
            "Next time, however, we will see that it was not so much the matter of citizenship for a few hundred coloreds that drove the big whites into revolt when they found out about the Reubell amendment, but the precedent that if it chose to do so, the National Assembly would legislate on colonial internal affairs. When news of the Reubell amendment hit Saint Domingue in July 1791, it will immediately spark a white revolt in the colony. This white revolt will soon be met by a counter revolt by the free coloreds who now have a decree from the National Assembly to righteously defend in the face of white treason. And while the whites and the coloreds were duking it out, slaves in the sugar plantations of the Northern Plains would quietly begin to meet and plot, and in August 1791, launch a spectacular uprising of their own that would change the new world forever.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So we ended last week with the momentous vote by the National Assembly in May 1791 to grant full citizenship to free people of color who were born of two free parents. The vote was taken at the end of an exhausting week of debate and was a last minute compromise. And it’s doubtful any of the delegates realize just how momentous this last minute compromise would turn out to be. And looking back at last week’s show, I noticed that I very foolishly neglected to mention the actual date the vote was taken. The date was May 15, which is important because everyone calls it the May 15 decree. So now you know why I am about to start calling it that. ",
            "Meanwhile, we left off in the colony in February 1791 with the execution of Vincent Ogé. And it is Ogé, not Ogay. Thanks to listener John for the correction. The deteriorating relationship between the whites and coloreds led to further arrests of armed coloreds throughout the colony over the winter. And we’re going to talk more about that in a minute. But oddly enough, it was patriotic small whites in Port-au-Prince who made the next overtly seditious move. Still angry that the Saint-Marc Assembly had been suppressed, the small white leaders plotted revenge on the royal administrators, even though the new royal governor, a guy named Blanchelande, had only arrived in the colony in October 1790 and he had nothing to do with it. ",
            "In March 1791, two new brigades of regular army troops arrived from France. And the small white leaders in the colonial capital ingratiated themselves with the newly arrived enlisted men who had themselves been bathed in two years of revolutionary rhetoric. Within days, a full blown mutiny against the royalist garrison commandant broke out, forcing Governor Blanchelande and his staff to flee north to Le Cap. The small whites now effectively controlled the capital of Saint Domingue. ",
            "Even after this incident, though, elections began for a Second Colonial Assembly to replace the failed Saint-Marc Assembly. And it was in the final stages of these elections that news of the May 15 decree arrived in the colony at the end of June. The news set off an immediate firestorm. Not only was the Metropole trying to end the apartheid system, they were unilaterally legislating beyond their prescribed jurisdiction. Throughout the colony, the electors threatened to tell their delegates to vote for immediate independence if the authorities actually tried to enforce this illegal encroachment on their internal sovereignty. Governor Blanchelande, already chased out of his capital, immediately wrote back to his superiors and said, “I cannot enforce this decree.” So the collective revolt of the white colonists in mid 1791 is the first of our three revolts. ",
            "Meanwhile, the free coloreds of Saint Domingue were just as incensed as the whites after the arrival of the May 15 decree, but for the opposite reason. In the last 18 odd months since the colony had first learned of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the coloreds had continued to endure unjust racial discrimination at the hands of the whites. Then, of course, in February, they had watched Ogé get broken on the wheel and beheaded for what? Standing up for those rights. Well, now we finally have a decree from the National Assembly confirming that race cannot and should not play a role in politics, economics or social relations. And instead of accepting this decree from the Metropole, the whites are gathering to declare independence. ",
            "Now, up in the North Province, whites totally outnumbered coloreds. But down in the west and south provinces, the coloreds were at least equal to the white population, and in some areas formed a clear majority. So all through July 1791, while whites burned effigies of the Abbe Grégoire and Le Cap and threatened to declare independence, coloreds in the west and south talked amongst themselves. On August 7, about 40 colored representatives met in a church in the town of Mirebalais, a town about 30 miles inland from Port-au-Prince, to protest the white reaction. They demanded immediate enforcement of the May 15 decree specifically and the Declaration of the Rights of Man generally. They wanted every white’s only assembly on the island declared illegal for not allowing qualified coloreds to vote or participate. But up in Le Cap, Governor Blanchelande was more concerned with the existing white revolt than a potential colored revolt, and he refused the demands and ordered the Mirebalais Assembly to disperse. With the governor siding with the treasonous whites who stood in defiance to the King and the National Assembly, the colored decided not to disperse, but instead to take up arms. And this is the second of our three revolts. ",
            "Now, one of the 40 colored delegates at the Mirebalais Assembly is super important to the whole rest of the course of the Haitian revolution. So let’s go ahead and introduce him right now: 30 year old goldsmith André Rigaud. Rigaud was born in 1761 in Les Cayes, the capital of the South Province. He was a mulatto, his father was a big white planter, and his mother was a slave. Now, unlike Julien Raimond, Rigaud was too young to know any system but the apartheid system. But even still, he was recognized as a legitimate son by his father, educated in France, where he was trained as a goldsmith. Historical tradition also has Rigaud being one of the volunteers who took part in the siege of Savannah, but sadly, there is no solid record of him actually taking part in the expedition. By the mid 1780s, Rigaud was back in Les Cayes, making a go of it as a goldsmith. ",
            "As the atmosphere in the colony charged after 1789, Rigaud was in the middle of free colored activism. And when the Ogé uprising began in October 1790, an armed Rigaud joined a few hundred of his neighbors down in the south. But Ogé was defeated before a colony-wide colored rebellion could begin. After Ogé’s arrest, Rigaud was then himself arrested in January 1791 for allegedly helping to incite an aborted slave rebellion. Thrown into prison in Port-au-Prince, he was very possibly slated for torture and execution. But the mutiny of the Port-au-Prince garrison in March allowed Rigaud and his fellow prisoners to escape. After that, he lingered in the backcountry of the West Province, not believing it was safe to return home to Les Cayes. When the colored assembly met in Mirebalais in August, Rigaud joined and served as its secretary. Now, among the colored leaders, Rigaud was a staunch advocate, not just for enforcing the May 15 decree, but for total racial quality. Born of a slave woman, or at least a woman who could not prove that she was free, Rigaud would not have qualified as a full citizen under the May 15 formulation, so anything less than full equality was simply not an option for the proud young man. And whatever trajectory Rigaud thought he was on, he probably would not have believed that in just a few years, he would be the master of the entire southern peninsula, because, spoiler alert, that’s where André Rigaud is headed. ",
            "As the 30,000 whites were rising up in revolt to defend their right to oppress the 30,000 coloreds, and as those 30,000 coloreds were rising up in revolt against that oppression, the 500,000 slaves watched with increasing interest. And just as July 1791 was a time for the whites to organize a revolt and for the coloreds to organize a revolt, the slaves, too, began to organize the third and most spectacular of our three revolts, specifically, the slaves and the all-important sugar plantations of the Northern Plains. The most lucrative part of the most lucrative colony in the world was about to be consumed by blood and fire. ",
            "Now, as I mentioned back in Episode 4.1, the leaders of the slave revolt were drawn from the ranks of the elite slaves, primarily drivers and coachmen, almost all Creole, trusted by the whites and enjoying certain privileges of movement. These guys were well plugged into the tensions that had been brewing in the colonies since 1789. With an easy reach of news from Le Cap and well versed in internal colonial politics, the elite slaves of the Northern Plains knew all about the revolution back in France and its divisive effect on the free population of Saint Domingue. And then, when the May 15 decree hit, and every part of the free population of the colony started getting ready to revolt against every other part of the free population in the colony, the slave leaders were like, I think we might be able to exploit this. Plus, rumors were now swirling that beyond the May 15 decree, the King and the National Assembly had granted further rights to the slaves. They had abolished the use of the whip and had granted three days off a week, but that the evil masters were intentionally suppressing the news, which isn’t exactly far-fetched. ",
            "So throughout July, and early August, the slave communities of the north began to organize and recruit members for a fullblown insurrection. On Sunday, August 14, leading slaves from practically every parish in the Northern Plains met at a plantation just 5 miles from Le Cap. This meeting was not secret, as large gatherings of trusted slaves were tolerated by the masters as necessary for general morale. But for sure, the masters did not know what the slaves were talking about. By this point, all the groundwork had been laid. And so the purpose of the August 14 meeting was simply to set a date for the revolt. The plan was for the slaves out on the plantations and slaves inside Le Cap to rise up simultaneously. Caught in a double eruption, the free citizens of the colony would have nowhere to turn. Now, some of the slave leaders argued that we start the revolt, like, right now, today. But the hotheads lost to more careful planners, who almost certainly picked Wednesday, August 24, as the day. The date was chosen to coincide with the first meeting of the Second Colonial Assembly in Le Cap. The slave leaders were savvy. If things went according to plan, they would sever the head of the master class with one bold stroke. ",
            "But things did not go according to plan. On August 16, a few of the slave insurrectionaries jumped the gun and set fire to a part of their plantation. Then, four days later, a few of the culprits were captured, and one spilled the beans. He said there was a widespread conspiracy that was planning to launch a mass uprising in just a few days. But in response to this shocking news, the white masters did nothing, which was a curious decision. And the general consensus among historians seems to be that they just couldn’t believe it was possible that for all their paranoia about slave uprisings and for all their wailing that any interference with internal colonial affairs would lead to a slave revolt, the masters simply did not believe the slaves were capable of a unified uprising. The blacks had been terrorized into submission, and besides, everyone knew slaves were naturally lazy and stupid. ",
            "Word spread through the slave communities about the fire and the capture of the arsonists. Afraid that the whole operation was about to be blown. The rebel leaders gathered together on the night of August 21, this time very much in secret, to decide how to respond. In the mythology of the Haitian revolution, this meeting in a wooded area called Bois-Caïman is the genesis of everything. Not just the slave revolt, but also slave emancipation and eventually the declaration of independence and founding of modern Haiti 13 years later. I have cobbled together various images of the Bois-Caïman ceremony and thrown them up at www.revolutionspodcast.com, along with some other illustrations from this all important summer of 1791. You can go check them out at your leisure. ",
            "Now, there are no true eyewitness accounts of the Bois-Caïman meeting, and a lot of romantic details were piled onto the story as the years went by. But we do have a general idea of what happened. For one thing, the meeting took the form of a Voodoo ceremony. Voodoo and Saint Domingue had developed as a mixture of various African religions mashed together with a few trappings of Catholicism. Technically, Voodoo was forbidden by the Code Noir, but Voodoo ceremonies had been tolerated by the masters as harmless religious and social outlets for the slaves.  Voodoo plays an important role in the brewing insurrection because, as we discussed earlier, the slaves came from a geographically, ethnically and linguistically diverse population back in Africa. And once deposited in Saint Domingue, Voodoo became one of the few points of common ground for all the blacks, wherever they had come from. New arrivals could see elements of familiar ceremonies in Gods, right here in this terrible new world. ",
            "So the Bois-Caïman ceremony was presided over by a Voodoo priestess and then a priest named Boukman. But Boukman was not just a religious leader, he was also the principal leader of the entire uprising. Boukman had at one point been a driver and was most likely a coachman in the summer of 1791. There was also strong suspicion that he had come to Saint Domingue by way of Jamaica and that he had been deported from the British colony for being a troublemaker. The grand tradition of the revolution has Boukman sacrificing a black pig and then leading the drinking of its blood to bind all the would-be insurgents together. Tradition also gives him a speech wherein he says",
            "“The God of the white man calls on him to commit crimes. Our God asks only good works of us, but this God who is so good orders revenge. He will direct our hand, he will aid us. Throw away the image of the God of the whites who thirst for our tears and listen to the voice of liberty that speaks in the hearts of all of us.” ",
            "The practical upshot of this quasi-mythical Bois-Caïman ceremony was that the insurrection was moved up to the very next night, August 22 1791. Unfortunately, this meant abandoning the simultaneous rising in Le Cap. But better to act now than not be able to act at all. ",
            "I’m going to pause here for a moment and make a point. We’ve been through three major revolutions now, and at the beginning of each, we’ve seen English roundheads, American colonists and French revolutionaries crying about liberty and tyranny, arguing that various despotic tyrants wanted to make them all slaves. The word ‘slave’ was on the tip of all their tongues all the time. It was a condition that filled their enlightened minds with existential dread. And yet, who were these guys in reality? They were usually well to do. They were respectable, well educated, comfortable. They wore nice clothes, they slept in fluffy beds. Usually what they described as slavery was a relatively innocuous tax hike. I mean, currently, the whites and Saint Domingue are ready to start a revolution. Why? Because the National Assembly doesn’t want them to oppress the coloreds quite so much? So for as much overwrought handwringing as we’ve seen over all our revolutions about slavery and tyranny, we are now finally seeing for the first time, actual slaves rising up against actual tyranny. ",
            "So on August 22, 1791, the insurrection officially began in the parish of Acul. A plantation manager later wrote a firsthand account saying that he was asleep in his bed when a group of slaves came into his room and said that they had to talk to him. But then suddenly, brandished machetes and attacked. He managed to fend them off, but in trying to raise the alarm, it became clear that this was not a small gang, this was a band of hundreds. By the next morning, the insurrection had spread from Acul to Limbé, with as many as 2,000 slaves now marching together from plantation to plantation, armed with machetes – the tool of their enslavement – but also swords and at least a few guns, the latter weapons having been entrusted to the drivers for hunting and keeping the other slaves in line. As the slaves marched, they killed any of the hated managers and overseers they came across, as well as slaves who refused to join the rebellion or who the insurgents thought too loyal to the whites. But the killing was not totally indiscriminate. Anyone identified as a doctor or surgeon was taken prisoner because they might prove useful, and priests were generally left unharmed for superstitious or political reasons. There are also numerous instances of slaves saving the lives of various whites and either allowing them to slip away unharmed or making sure they were simply taken prisoner rather than murdered. As the revolt progressed, nearly every slave camp had its fair share of prisoners. ",
            "But though the initial killing sprees were shocking, nothing defined the initial revolt so much as fire. Fire everywhere. In fact, the principal object of the moment was not hunting down and killing the masters, but reducing their beloved sugar empire to ashes. Everything was put to the torch. Cane fields, which burn very easily, plantation houses, all that expensive industrial equipment, the boilers that had scalded slave bodies, the presses that had ripped off black limbs – all of it was set ablaze, and all of it just left to burn. ",
            "Meanwhile, further east, in the North Province, separate uprisings were launched. But by now, the alarm was spreading as fast as the fires, and quick witted plantation managers were able to organize a hasty defense. So by the afternoon of August 23, the genuine battles were now being fought. Sometimes the slaves overcame their masters and the killings and fires preceded. Sometimes the masters beat the slaves, and the plantation managed to survive at least for a few more hours. But these successful holdouts were for sure the exception. Thousands of slaves every hour, better armed and more numerous swept across the northern plains. Within a few days, something like 200 sugar plantations and 1,200 coffee plantations had been burned to the ground. By August 27, the slave armies, and they were now truly becoming armies, were estimated at 10,000 strong. ",
            "The free men and women who lived out on the plantations were by now either dead, prisoners or streaming into Le Cap as refugees with literally nothing but the clothes on their back. The residents of Le Cap at first could not believe the stories coming in. But as more refugees arrived, their terror mounted. And by then the pillars of smoke were rising from the plains all around them. And as the fire spread, the entire horizon took on a persistent ominous glow and the sky grew hazy with ash and soot. The residents of Le Cap could actually watch the progress of the revolt by the appearance of new smoke columns and by the extension of that ominous glow to previously darkened areas. Governor Blanchelande and the Colonial Assembly wasted no time preparing to defend the city from inevitable attack. They barricaded all access points and roads and mustered every available soldier and national guardsmen to defend the perimeter. A few attacks on the city were launched by the slaves. But without the requisite firepower to actually take a fortified city, the attacks failed, leaving a pile of dead slave bodies in their wake. But just to be safe, Governor Blanchelande also closed the Le Cap harbor and refused to allow ships to leave. He wanted to make sure that everyone would be able to get out, should it come down to that. ",
            "The residents of Le Cap then naturally grew incredibly paranoid about all the slaves in their midst. The population of the city was about 18,000, but fully 12,000 of those were slaves. 6,000 men and 6,000 women. The free citizens believed that even the most loyal slaves were now about to murder them all in their beds. So any slave even slightly suspected was just executed. On August 25, 100 slaves were dispatched in a single mass execution, all very public and all designed to keep the rest in line. True to their own form, the small whites of Le Cap marched around targeting any free colored they could find, simply assuming that they must be the ultimate instigators of the uprising. A few coloreds were lynched, but the municipal authorities cracked down on all this, believing that the whites might have to gasp ally with the coloreds against the slaves. ",
            "Now, in the first weeks of the insurrection, Governor Blanchelande was in a nearly impossible situation. The plantation owners and refugees demanded he send out the army garrison to crush the rebels. But just as loudly, the residents of Le Cap demanded he stay put and not leave them to be slaughtered. And though he did send out a few small sorties on particular missions, for the most part Blanchelande settled in on a policy of defense. Hold Le Cap, then, when the initial revolt was literally burned out, we’ll be able to go out and restore order. The horrified plantation owners then accused Blanchelande of secretly wanting the slaves to succeed which brings us to a very interesting discussion of the myriad conspiracy theories the free inhabitants cooked up to explain who was really behind the slave revolt. I mean, the slaves themselves are uniformly stupid and lazy so who’s really calling the shots and why? ",
            "So just so you can get a sense of how paranoid Saint Domingue was by early September 1791, let’s run through a few of these theories. First, there was the belief that this was the work of uppity coloreds using a slave revolt to secure their own alleged rights. This was a favorite of the small whites. The big whites meanwhile, believed that it was the damn Friends of the Blacks back in France and all that abolitionist talk, that their radical polemics had made their way into slave hands who were then inspired to rise up. Then there was the exact opposite theory that some big whites had actually helped trigger the uprising so that they could blame the May 15 decree for triggering a slave uprising. But others thought, no, this is actually a conspiracy masterminded by Blanchelande. With the big whites threatening independence, he had sparked the revolt and was now busy not putting it down. All the easier to reassert the tyrannical authority of the Metropole. Each theory had its adherence and though some coloreds did indeed join and even serve as officers in the slave armies, most of those guys were veterans of the Ogé rebellion now coming out of hiding, mostly Occam’s razor is at play here. Astute slave leaders recognized that the master class was divided and distracted and took their shot at throwing off their chains. I think in the end it pretty much is that simple. ",
            "Okay, so who were some of these astute slave leaders? Besides Boukman, who was quite literally the spiritual leader of the whole rebellion, there are three others of particular note, and before you ask, no, it is not yet time for Toussaint Louverture. First, there was a guy named Jean-François. Jean-François is notable for being practically the only maroon leader of the bunch, coming down from the mountains to help plot the uprising and then lead its growing armies. His runaway notice in 1787 described Jean-François as Creole, aged about 22, 5’10 in height, slim, good looking, branded on the right side of the chest ‘RB’ and above ‘Mr. M’, with a long scar under his chin. Jean-François was smart, courageous and as we will see next week, an utterly ruthless pragmatist. ",
            "Next we have Georges Biassou, who was more extravagant and flamboyant than Jean-François. A deep believer in Voodoo, Biassou kept himself surrounded with priests who advised him daily on how to proceed. He was also far more hungry for revenge than either Boukman or Jean-François and moderated his passions only very reluctantly. Jean-François and Biassou will remain two of the principal slave commanders all the way through until 1795, when … well, we’ll get to all of that down the road. ",
            "Finally, we have to introduce a leader who was subordinate to Jean-François in the somewhat fluid slave command structure, but who is not going to make it out of 1791 alive: Jeannot. Jeannot is infamous in the history of the revolution as probably the cruelest of the slave leaders. Being taken prisoner by a slave army was understandably terrifying, but falling into Jeannot’s hands meant torture and death, full stop. Jeannot was happy to recreate for the former masters all the cruel tortures that had been inflicted on the slaves for the past century, and he took very evident delight in the suffering of his captives. He even executed a fellow slave leader for allegedly helping a white family escape. But perhaps because of his murderous zeal, Jeannot was also a very effective fighter. And on September 10, it was Jeannot’s army who captured the town of Dondon, which guaranteed access to the Spanish side of the island, which will turn out to be absolutely critical to maintaining the insurrection. ",
            "All through September, the slaves were basically winning. They now numbered at least 20,000, with other contemporary guesses putting it at closer to 80,000. And the ranks just kept growing. Whatever potential middle ground might have existed between moderate whites looking to negotiate or moderate slaves not wanting to join the rebellion disappeared in a storm of mutual atrocities. The blacks decorated their camps with the heads of whites. The whites decorated the perimeter of Le Cap with the heads of blacks. It was dangerous to be white and council moderation. It was almost suicidal to be black and not join the insurrection. So every day, the ranks of the slave army swelled. By the end of October, they controlled the entire eastern half of the North Province, making bases in the mountains, on former plantations, and in occupied towns. ",
            "The success of the slave army was shocking and incredibly frustrating to the master class. Though they had started with machetes, the slaves had seized arms and equipment wherever they went, and soon deployed even cannons. As they systematically seized territory in the North Province, they could rely on sheer numbers against terrified civilians. But when they did meet armed resistance, as they did most especially in the east, they fought using a brand of warfare unfamiliar to the Europeans. Many of the slaves that had recently arrived on the island had effectively been prisoners of war in tribal conflicts back in Africa, and they fought using African methods. They set traps everywhere and deployed small autonomous units to ambush isolated militias or convoys. They always attacked from behind cover, and if they met determined resistance, they simply melted backwards in a rapid retreat, which European observers often mistook for cowardice. But if the slaves detected an opportunity, they would blow a menacing conch shell, signaling a mass attack. And the casualty ratio during 1791 ran as high as ten to one slave to master. But with the widespread Voodoo belief that death meant a return of the spirit to Africa, the slaves were fearless in the charges and relentless in attack. ",
            "But despite these advantages and success, the momentum of the slave insurrection finally stalled out. In mid November, Boukman himself was killed in a skirmish and the death of their spiritual leader caused great fear and dread to sweep through the slave armies. And they cried, “Boukman is dead! What will become of us?” Then rivalries among the leaders started to break out as conflicting agendas began to surface. On November 1, Jean-François marched into Jeannot’s camp, arrested his subordinate and had him shot. The standard line was that Jeannot’s cruelty was damaging the moral authority of the rebellion and would only make negotiating with Le Cap that much harder. But it’s just as likely that the charismatic and talented Jeannot was about to start posing a threat to Jean-François’ own authority. And so Jean-François had his rival executed. ",
            "Then Governor Blanchelande did finally manage to organize a successful military operation. He did not have the manpower to defeat the mass rebellion, but he was able to fortify and garrison a string of military forts through the mountains that divided the North Province from the West Province. These forts were called the Cordon of the West and they effectively contained the main rebellion to the North Province. So by the end of November 1791, the momentum of the slave revolt stalled and a stalemate set in. ",
            "Now, while all of this was unfolding in the north, down in the West Province, armed conflict had also broken out in August 1791, but it was between the whites and the coloreds rather than the masters and the slaves. After Governor Blanchelande had rejected their demands in mid August, the coloreds in Mirebalais armed themselves and prepared to fight for their rights. The small white dominated Port-au-Prince sent a detachment of dragoons up to break up this little rebellion. But the dragoons were soundly grubbed. Knowing that another, bigger attack would no doubt follow, the coloreds took a momentous step in the history of the Haitian revolution. They promised freedom to any slave who fought for them. The slaves who came forward were a mix of plantation slaves and maroons. And they were soon nicknamed the Swiss, after our old friends, the mercenary Swiss Guards who protected the monarchy back in Paris. I should note, however, that this recruitment of slaves started before the slaves in the north went into revolt and the two are entirely unrelated. Though the existence of the Swiss was later taken as proof that the coloreds were secretly behind the slave revolt. ",
            "In early September, Port-au-Prince finally sent out a larger force. But when they arrived, they found themselves battling coloreds and slaves. The coloreds-slave force won the ensuing battle and many of the defeated whites fled into the cane fields to hide. But of course, as we’ve seen, cane fields burn very easily. The coloreds put the field to the torch, and the trapped whites all burned to death. ",
            "With the coloreds obviously superior soldiers and word of the slave revolt now arriving in gruesome detail, the big whites in the West Province reassess their position. On September 5, a prominent representative of the big whites approached the coloreds of Mirebalais and said, let’s talk. A few days later, the two sides signed a deal called the Concordat, that amounted to the total capitulation of the big whites to colored demands. The document began with an admission that the whites had violated both the Code Noir and the May 15 decree, that racial apartheid was legally and morally wrong, and then they apologized for all this and agreed to support its total abolition. They also called for the dissolution of any public assembly that had been elected without the votes or participation of the coloreds, which meant all of them. This model Concordat then spread to other small towns and parishes in both the west and south provinces. So with this new alliance of big whites, coloreds and Swiss slaves controlling the countryside around Port-au-Prince, the more radical small white leaders inside the capital began to lose influence, especially with fear of the slave revolt now dominating everyone’s imagination. By the end of October, the small whites finally gave it up. And at some point between October 19 and 23rd (I’ve seen different dates), all parties signed the Second Concordat, which reaffirmed the previous Concordat. It also included the stipulation that quote “terms such as citizen of color and the free black, free mulatto, free quadroon known as and others of the sort shall be in the future strictly prohibited. Henceforth, they will be used for all the colony citizens only those terms used for the whites.” To great and somewhat forced fanfare, the coloreds and Swiss marched into Port-au-Prince, and on October 24, there was a big unity party. And for the briefest of moments, big whites, small whites, free coloreds, and at least some slaves were all on the same side. ",
            "This alliance is not going to hold together. ",
            "The first faction to get cut out was naturally, the Swiss. With the slave revolt in the north now raging, it would be the height of folly to keep freed slaves under arms. So in a secret side agreement, the colored leaders agreed to renege on their promise of freedom. The slave fighters were disarmed and marched onto a ship for immediate deportation from the island. Now, the captain of the ship was supposed to sell the Swiss somewhere along the Central American coast. But understandably, no one wanted to buy slaves coming from Saint Domingue. So the captain sailed down to Jamaica and simply put them ashore on a deserted beach. When the British authorities were alerted to this, they rounded the Swiss up, put them on a boat, and sailed them back to Port-au-Prince. But as soon as the ship appeared in the harbor, the municipal authorities in the capital were like, we’re not taking these guys back under any circumstances. They outright executed about 60 of the Swiss and left the rest to rot aboard the ship, most perishing from disease or starvation. The story of the fate of the Swiss spread quickly through all the slave communities in Saint Domingue, and was a source of permanent mistrust between the blacks and the coloreds for the whole rest of the revolution. ",
            "Meanwhile, back in Paris, the National Assembly was about to blow up the ground upon which the white-colored alliance had just been forged. In fact, they had actually already blown it up before the Second Concordat was even signed. So we’ll wrap up today by zooming back over to France, and where are we now in the French Revolution? Well, while Saint Domingue was reeling from the May 15 decree in June 1791, Paris was reeling from the flight to Varennes and all of its consequences. And as you’ll recall from Episode 3.20, the most immediate political consequence was bringing the triumvirate of Duport, Lameth, and Antoine Barnave to power. And of course, we last saw Barnave as the head of the Colonial Committee, and he had never been a fan of the May 15 decree, believing that matters of race were best left to the colonists. He had, in fact, used his influence to stall the appointment of the three commissioners who would have officially implemented the May 15 decree. So, as the National Assembly was preparing to hand power to the Legislative Assembly at the end of September 1791, Barnave engineered a repeal of the May 15 decree. On September 24, just days before the National Assembly disbanded, the delegates voted to annul its previous extension of citizenship to the free coloreds. Only then were three commissioners appointed to go enforce the Metropole’s authority in Saint Domingue – authority that now emphatically did not include race. So by the time the Concordats were signed, the three commissioners were already in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, bringing the news that defending racial apartheid was no longer equivalent to treason. And the chair upon which the colored stood to make their case for equality was about to be kicked out from under them. ",
            "Next week, these three commissioners will arrive in Le Cap ready to implement the Metropole’s new colonial policy. But what will they wind up doing instead? That’s right – negotiating with the huge slave army they knew nothing about, because news of the massive slave revolt had not reached France when these three commissioners put to sea. These guys have absolutely no conception of the hellfire they are about to walk into.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So last time Saint Domingue erupted into a massive threeway revolt that was capped off with the unfathomable slave uprising. And it did not take long for the rest of the world to learn of the shocking events in the French colony. It should come as no surprise that the rest of European civilization blew right past the white threats of independence and colored demands for equality and focused exclusively on the slaves. It also probably comes as no surprise that the atrocities committed by the slaves dominated the reports, like the rumor that the slaves were using the head of a dead white child as their military standard, which, oddly enough, is almost exactly the same imagery that filtered back to England when news of the Irish rebellion hit London in 1642 – we talked about that in Episode 1.4. ",
            "News spread quickly throughout the Caribbean, in particular because Governor Blanchelande was sending out distress calls in all directions, most especially to the British in Jamaica and the Spanish over on the other side of the island in Santo Domingo. But the response from his European brothers was either noncommittal or openly hostile. The British sympathized and promised aid, and in time, a small embassy did arrive to sympathize in person, but nothing resembling actual aid, you know, guns and men who know how to use them. Meanwhile, over in Santo Domingo, the Spanish appeared perfectly happy to watch the French colony burn to the ground. Not unlike the great powers of Europe, who were happily watching France be consumed by the Revolution. And more than just watch, the Spanish in Santo Domingo were soon actively trading with the slave armies, exchanging weapons and supplies for items looted from the ransacked and burned plantations. Jean-François and Biassou, the two principal slave generals, both played up their cause as a defense of good King Louis against the loathsome patriot revolutionaries. They even called themselves Royal Armies, saying that they were only fighting to implement the will of the King. Both generals started decking themselves out in fancy uniforms covered in fleur-de-lis, and the Spanish took a liking to all of this. And as we’ll see, when the mother countries go to war in early 1793, this burgeoning relationship between the slaves and the Spanish will become more formalized. ",
            "Then up in the newly established United States, the reaction was a mixture of fear, dread and, in plucky American fashion, a sense of economic opportunity. The southern states were mortified by the thought of slaves rising up, and they paid special attention to their own plantations. But they were also not facing a ten to one slave to free population ratio. So vigilance, yes, but they never did need more than that. The northern states, meanwhile, fretted about the loss of Saint Domingue products, especially the molasses they used to make rum. But at the same time, if things were really as bad as it sounded, the French colonists were going to need all the supplies they could get and would probably pay a pretty penny for it. So many northern merchants brave the revolt to engage in a little revolt profiteering. ",
            "Now, practically the last major power to find out about the revolt was France itself. Word of the slave uprising did not hit Paris until November. Now, the magnitude of the revolt sent the Friends of the Blacks into a political tailspin. Now, they had never advocated for anything but gradual emancipation and compensation to the owners, and advocated those measures in part to forestall exactly this sort of uprising. But for the moment, nobody wanted to hear it from the Friends of the Blacks. Abolition was no longer on the agenda, and soon enough, the Friends of the Blacks stopped holding regular meetings and focused on other aspects of their revolutionary careers. ",
            "But though abolition of slavery was, for the moment, taboo, equality for the free coloreds was suddenly back on the table, and this was because the founder of the Friends of the Blacks was Jacques Pierre Brissot. And we’re currently around Episode 3.21 in the French Revolution, when Brissot and his Girondin allies started dominating the newly convened Legislative Assembly. Brissot had a good working relationship with Julien Raimond, and Raimond hammered home his central point: you must give equality to the coloreds. It is no longer a matter of preventing a slave revolt, it’s about successfully overcoming one. And because Brissot was now so central in the Legislative Assembly, this argument got a fair hearing. The big white interests in the Club Massiac, on the other hand, had just watched all their carefully cultivated allies in the National Assembly voluntarily resigned from power. And so when they begged the Legislative Assembly to send an army to Saint Domingue, the Legislative Assembly agreed to send 6,000 more troops. But then Brissot said “You won’t get any more until you agree to colored equality.” And though he was obviously withholding the troops as leverage, we know that Brissot was likely withholding the troops for a different reason. He was busy plotting war with Austria and needed every man he could get. ",
            "Now, as I said at the end of last week’s show, amongst the very, very last people to find out about the great slave revolt were the three commissioners who had been sent by the National Assembly to act as their representatives in the colony. And when these three guys stepped off the boat on November 29, 1791, it must have been one of the biggest what the *bleep* moments in history. Le Cap is a city under siege. Practically the entire Northern Plains are occupied by a slave army and the whole place has been burned to the ground. And down south, the whites and coloreds have started a civil war. So let’s see, what do our instructions say about slave revolt and civil war? Oh right, we don’t have anything about that, so eh yeah…",
            "The three commissioners were in an even more impossible situation than the beleaguered Governor Blanchelande. They came carrying official news that the May 15 decree had been repealed and that on matters of race and slavery the citizens of Saint Domingue are sovereign and have full authority. So on the two most important matters facing the colony, the three commissioners had literally zero jurisdiction. They were basically glorified ambassadors. ",
            "But as we also discussed at the end of last week, by the time the commissioners arrived things had settled into a stalemate. The slave armies controlled most of the Northern Plains as well as the mountains to the east and south at bordered Santo Domingo. Meanwhile, the city of Le Cap was under siege but not in significant danger of being overrun. And Governor Blancheland had just established a cordon of the west which successfully contained the uprising in the north. The loss of momentum was worrying to the slave leaders because the slave soldiers were starting to get restless. Having failed to just sweep the hated masters off the island completely, their concerns now turn to more mundane issues like food and medicine and why we don’t have enough of either, and of course the overbearing orders of their officers. Discipline suffered and the generals wondered how much longer they would be able to keep the rebellion going. So perhaps the time had come to negotiate. ",
            "As soon as the three commissioners were briefed on the situation. They immediately said to the colonists “Negotiate!”. They also said, “We have a way for you to do it”. When King Louis signed the Constitution of 1791, he had issued a general political amnesty, so that’s the perfect means to bring this revolt to an end. But the Colonial Assembly refused to even consider it. They believed that reinforcements would inevitably arrive from France, that the slave army would naturally fall apart and in no time be crushed. The King’s amnesty was for citizens, not murderous brigands. But though the colonists dug in their heels, Jean-François and Biassou took a shot at negotiating anyway. In early December, they issued four principal demands and I quote now from a military dispatch “First, a full and complete pardon for the officer corps and the legal registration of their freedom. Second, a general amnesty for all the slaves. Third, freedom for the leaders to withdraw to wherever they wish in a foreign country if they choose to leave. And fourth, the full enjoyment of the effects in their possession.” ",
            "In exchange for meeting these demands the generals agreed to order their followers back to the plantations where sugar cultivation, coffee cultivation and slavery would all resume their natural course. So, yes, in December 1791 the leaders of the slave revolt attempted to sell all of their followers back into chains in exchange for their own personal freedom. Now, this is both morally deplorable and ruthlessly pragmatic. Jean-François, for example, does not appear to have believed that mass emancipation was possible or even desirable. He likely had the same general outlook as the Friends of the Blacks back in Paris. Gradual emancipation over a long period: good. Sudden mass emancipation: bad. ",
            "Now, one of the leaders advising limited emancipation for the leaders only was a recent arrival in the slave camps whose role in the early rebellion remained shrouded in a bit of mystery. He was not even a slave himself but rather an ex-slave who had been serving as the manager of a plantation in the Northern Plains in the summer of 1791: Toussaint Louverture. Right now he is known as Toussaint de Bréda, but history knows him as Toussaint Louverture. So we’ll just cut right to the chase on that one and besides, mostly I’ll just be calling him Toussaint anyway. ",
            "Born a slave probably in the early 1740s on a sugar plantation in the north, Toussaint was a black Creole. No European blood at all, born in the Americas. But he did manage to hit what amounted to the slave jackpot: a relatively kind and generous master. Young Toussaint was scrawny and weak, but his mind was bright and active. His master, seeing the boy’s promise, made sure he received a rudimentary education. Soon Toussaint could read and speak French. He understood basic mathematics, politics and economics. Clearly, he was being groomed for a leadership role on the plantation. Historical tradition also has Toussaint reading the Abbé Raynal’s famous “History of the Two Indies” with its searching call for a black Spartacus. But those copies of the book were on the island, so far as I can tell, there’s no direct evidence that Toussaint actually sat down and read the book prior to the slave revolt. ",
            "So the educated Toussaint then rose up the slave hierarchy. He was a coachman, then he moved into caring for the horses where he became an expert rider, and then he took on overall management of the plantation’s livestock. A job that brought him into contact with whites, and coloreds, and slaves, necessitated frequent trips to Le Cap and constant daily management of tons of details, both big and small. Soon enough, Toussaint was a worldly and wellknown fixture of life in the Northern Plains, respected by masters and slaves alike. And he was affectionately known as Papa Toussaint. ",
            "In 1776, when Toussaint was in his early 30s, his master allowed him to purchase his freedom, whereupon he stayed on the plantation as a free black manager. He then married his wife, the still enslaved Suzanne Simon-Baptiste, in the early 1780s and then tried his luck as a small hold farmer, running property of his own with perhaps a dozen slaves. But Toussaint does not appear to have succeeded as an independent planter because when the revolution broke out, he was back at his home plantation as its manager. It is entirely possible that it was just better to live with his family, which now included a few small children. ",
            "As one of the prominent black leaders in the north in the summer of 1791, it is impossible to imagine Toussaint not knowing what was being planned. But his actual role in the early stages of the rebellion is pretty unknown. Was he at the August 14 meeting? Was he at Bois-Caïman? We don’t know. What we do know is that he was not amongst those leading the initial charge. He instead remained on his plantation and kept the slaves there from joining the fight. There are a few different theories to explain this. One is that Toussaint was in on the plan, but that his role was to stay put and act as a spy and informant among the whites. Another is that Toussaint was smart and pragmatic. A slave uprising is a dicey proposition and he stayed out of it until it became clear that the thing was not just going to fall apart after a few days. There is also a theory that Toussaint’s principal role was acting as the liaison with the royal administrators who were looking to spark the uprising to put down the big whites. And that Toussaint had then used this opportunity to trick the whites into thinking he was working for them, when really he was using them to create space for the slave revolt. Toussaint’s early history has clearly been rewritten more than once. And if you ask me, given the arc of his career, I would guess that wait-and-see Toussaint probably gets the closest to the truth. ",
            "Whatever his role, by the fall of 1791 Toussaint elected to join the rebellion in full. He ensured that the widow of his old master made it safely to Le Cap, told his wife and children to make for Santo Domingo and then left to join the slave armies. Older and far better educated than the top generals, I mean, he was in his mid 40s, while Jean-François was maybe 25 and illiterate, Toussaint glided easily into the upper rungs of the rebellion. From that position, he played a key role in the negotiations of November and December 1791 between the slaves and the white leaders in Le Cap. The first time his personal signature appears in the historical record is affixed to a letter drafted on behalf of Jean-François and Biassou outlining their principal demands. Toussaint was clearly an advocate of limiting the aims of the rebellion and probably advised everyone to ratchet down their expectations. But at the same time, he urged the whites in Le Cap to make the deal for God’s sake. By now, the slave generals were claiming they had about 100,000 men under arms and if this was an exaggeration, it likely wasn’t much of one. The whites could have ended this for basically nothing. But the whites resisted. They countered and said, lay down your arms and return to the plantations and we might consider amnesty. ",
            "The three commissioners, for their part, kept up the negotiations and held independent meetings with Jean-François and also urged the Colonial Assembly to please take the extraordinarily good deal on the table. By the end of the negotiations, the slave generals may have demanded freedom for as few as 60 of the principal leaders in exchange for ending the revolt. But the whites said no. This intransigence cost them everything. It also meant that Jean-François, Biassou and Toussaint never had to face what would have been a very scary proposition: telling tens of thousands of armed slaves who have just spent the last three months engaged in a bloody war for freedom, “Thanks, guys. We’re all now free. But you’re slaves again. That’s cool, right?” Instead, they ordered their men on a new offensive in January 1791. And rather than the revolt being terrible but short, it became terrible and very, very long. ",
            "Meanwhile, down in the west, the situation was perhaps even more chaotic. As we saw last week, the battle lines in the west and south provinces were drawn between whites and coloreds rather than masters and slaves. At least, mostly. At the end of October 1791, everyone had signed the second Concordat that established a new alliance between the whites and coloreds on the basis of racial equality. But it also appears that within a week of this deal being signed the first rumor of the National Assembly’s reversal of the May 15 decree hit. But without the rumors being official and with the slave revolt still a major concern, the Concordat alliance held into late November. But the small whites in Port-au-Prince were really ticked off about it. And now, believing that the hated May 15 decree was a dead letter, they work daily to undermine support for the Concordat. ",
            "Now in fine French revolutionary fashion, the agreement was put to a public vote, and on November 21, Port-au-Prince was divided into four electoral sections and the voting commenced. By the end of the day, three sections had announced returns and the Concordat looked like it was going to pass and so the small whites implemented Plan B: spark a race riot. ",
            "A small white agitator approached a free black member of the colored militia on the street and started leveling enough insults to provoke a reaction. As soon as the black man retaliated, the municipal authorities rushed in and arrested the man. The free coloreds got wind of the trouble and rushed down to make sure their brother was treated with respect. And while all sides were arguing, the unfortunate black was seized by the small whites, taken out back and lynched. The free colored militia then mustered in force, and an open street battle broke out. But the coloreds were badly outnumbered. Unlike the small whites, most of the coloreds did not actually live in Port-au-Prince. And after the Concordat was signed, many had returned to their homes to tend to their affairs and keep the slaves in line. Forced into a fighting retreat, the coloreds in Port-au-Prince fled the city. And the small whites – they just went on a rampage. They not only killed any black or colored they could find, they also ransacked every nice house in the city, including those of the big whites as revenge for cutting a deal with the hated half breeds. By the next morning, a fire had broken out that could not be contained. 27 city blocks, roughly two thirds of the total city was consumed by fire in the next 48 hours.",
            "The violent breakdown of the Concordat in Port-au-Prince then spread throughout the west and south. It had been an uneasy truce at best, and everyone took the opportunity to attack everyone else. In November, the main colored leadership set up a base of operations in Croix-des-Bouquets, about 10 miles northeast of Port-au-Prince. They issued a general call to arms that said, among other things, “Let us plunge our bloodstained arms, avengers of perfidy and betrayal into the breasts of these monsters from Europe.” So that’s where we’re at now. Everywhere the coloreds rose up, but so too did the whites, especially down in the south, where there was little big white influence to mediate between the small whites and the coloreds, who just despised each other. Both sides then engaged in atrocities and the slaughter of prisoners. It was all very personal and very bitter. In the town of Jérémie, which those of you who read and or listened to The Black Count will remember as the childhood home of General Alex Dumas, armed whites rounded up coloreds and imprisoned them on boats infected with smallpox and then just left them there to die. ",
            "While the civil war was breaking out, the first truly organized mass slave uprising outside the North Province broke out, and it is a very interesting little story. This revolt was led by a young man named Romaine Rivière, who was a free colored, technically categorized as a grief, which was the child of one black and one mulatto. Don’t you just love how they sat around and worked all this stuff out as if it meant anything? Anyway, Romaine was Spanish-Congolese and likely migrated over to Saint Domingue from Santo Domingo. At some point right around in this era, September 1791, Romaine set himself up in an abandoned church in the mountains of the southern peninsula between Léogâne to the north and Jacmel to the south. There, he started an insurrectionary religious cult. He claimed that he was the godchild of the Virgin Mary and that she spoke to him directly all the time. Delivering fiery sermons with an inverted cross in one hand and a saber in the other, he said that God was black and that the time had come to overthrow the whites. He also publicly began calling himself Romaine-la-Prophétesse, deliberately taking on a female persona to heighten his link to the Virgin Mary. ",
            "The charismatic Prophétesse attracted followers by the thousands. Now, the dating of all this is difficult to pin down, but just as the second Concordat failed, Romaine’s army was well over 10,000 strong, and then it went on the offensive. They attacked Jacmel, but were repelled. But then, with the help of armed coloreds who were busy rising up against the whites, they attacked Léogâne and were totally successful. They seized the city and held it. The white citizens were forced to recognize Romaine-la-Prophétesse’s authority, and he settled in and acted as a self proclaimed dictator, issuing decrees, dispensing justice. But despite a principal coastal town being seized by armed rebel slaves, the whites and colored stayed focused on their civil war. And from the moment the Concordat snapped, both sides turned to the slaves to act as their shock troops. The coloreds of the west marched around to the various plantations, drumming up recruits, promising freedom to those who joined. But the slaves knew all about the Swiss. So many were like, yeah, thanks, but no thanks. In these situations, the coloreds were not above pressing slaves into service, burning down their homes or personal plots, or just saying, time to join or we’ll kill you. The whites in Port-au-Prince, meanwhile, were already organizing a black company from among the urban slaves. And then down in Les Cayes, the white dominated provisional assembly issued a decree mandating that every owner free 10% of his slaves and arm them for battle. Pretty soon, the clashes between the whites and coloreds were mostly clashes between slave and slave, fighting both sides of a war that basically had nothing to do with them, but they sure were getting a lot of combat experience. ",
            "The war in the West Province culminated in March. Of the three commissioners from France, Edmond de Saint-Léger, was dispatched to the province to try to A) defuse the civil war, and B) get everyone to recognize that the capture of a major coastal town by a slave rebel army was a bigger deal than their petty bickering. Saint-Léger managed to broker a temporary truce, and a combined force of whites and coloreds stormed Léogâne and took it back. Romaine-la-Prophétesse then disappears into history, never to return. ",
            "But while this force was so occupied, the small whites in Port-au-Prince decided this was the perfect opportunity to launch an attack on Croix-des-Bouquets. They marched up to the town and put it to a siege. Now, I can’t quite tell if they took the city and then lost it or if they just failed to take it completely, but the upshot was they lost the battle, and they lost principally because the coloreds had just cut a deal with a new slave leader who had quietly organized 15,000 men under everyone’s nose. This was a 22 year old slave named Hyacinthe. Like Boukman and the Prophétesse, Hyacinthe was a charismatic religious leader who carried around a talisman made of horsehair that he claimed could repel bullets. Allying with the coloreds, Hyacinthe led his army against the whites at Croix-des-Bouquets, and despite cannons furiously blasting them to bits, the slaves overcame the whites and drove them off. But Hyacinthe was also cut from the same cloth as Jean-François. He was not a proponent of mass immediate abolition. His demands included better treatment for the slaves and freedom for him and his officers. In exchange, he would make sure that they all returned to work. And when the battle was over, that’s what happened. ",
            "In the wake of this victory, commissioner Saint-Léger gave his sanction in April to a new assembly meeting once again in Saint-Marc, called the Council of Peace and Union. It was effectively a meeting of the signatories of the original Concordats, so the big white planters and the free coloreds. The angry small whites held fast to Port-au-Prince, and they denounced Saint-Léger, and the coloreds, and the slaves, and probably God himself by now. But they were surrounded now and under siege. Saint-Léger, meanwhile, said, “I have to go back to France and report on what’s happened, so I’ll see you guys later.” And that is the last we will see of him. ",
            "Okay, so it’s been a few minutes since we’ve talked about what’s going on back in France, and so let’s head back over there ourselves and make sure that yep, they’re about to completely reverse course again. We are now at about Episode 3.22. Brissot and the Girondins have forced a takeover of the Royal Ministry in preparation for declaring war on Austria. This meant that they now controlled the Colonial Ministry. And one of the ever so small parts of the deal bringing them to power was that Louis would sign off on a law that did not go back to the May 15 formulation, but a law that rocketed right past it. The government’s official position was now that the big whites in Saint Domingue were to blame for all the civil strife and the resulting slave uprising, that they were all engaged in a counterrevolutionary conspiracy to despoil the island and weaken France. So the Metropole now adopted Julien Raimond’s position fully, that the best way to reverse the damage was to abolish all racial categories, distinctions and privileges. Any free citizen who met the property requirements to be an active citizen was an active citizen. It didn’t matter who your parents were and it didn’t matter if you used to be a slave. The line between white and colored was abolished. Only the line between master and slave legally remained. The now fully recognized free coloreds would become known as the Citizens of April 4 and in time they will be contrasted with the Citizens of June 20, which we’ll be getting to soon enough. ",
            "So then the Legislative Assembly assigned three new commissioners, henceforth to be known as the Second Commission to implement the law. But unlike the First Commission, whose powers were limited, the Second Commission would have broad power and discretion. They were basically representatives on mission to Saint Domingue. The Second Commission is going to be really super important and so we’ll talk all about them next week in Episode 4.6, which just so happens to be called ‘the Second Commission’.",
            "At the end of May, the news of the Law of April 4 arrived and once again threw the colony into disarray. Governor Blanchelande had avoided formal recognition of the Council of Peace and Union, but when the new new orders arrived, he recognized the Assembly as valid. By mid-June, Blanchelande had sailed to the burned out Port-au-Prince himself, where a colored slave army was laying siege to the capital. He worked openly with the Council and he sanctioned the arrest of small white leaders and the disillusion of the all-white Provisional Assembly. Most of the small white leaders inside Port-au-Prince proceeded to flee the colony. Governor Blanchelande also validated the terms agreed to with Hyacinthe. The vast majority of the slaves would return to their plantations. The leaders would be freed, but only on the condition that they serve as the police force who would make sure that the slaves stayed put. By July, the slave insurrectionaries were resettling and the colored forces led by, among others, André Rigaud entered Port-au-Prince. ",
            "Blanchelande was happy to have the situation in the west now partially stabilized because he had his sights set on finally winning an actual military victory against slave insurgents. Unable to handle the armies in the north, Blanchelande was on his way to the tip of the southern peninsula. In the steep mountains above Les Cayes, a slave force had taken over a region called Platon and declared themselves to be the Kingdom of Platon. Negotiations between the slaves and masters in Les Cayes had gotten nowhere, and Blanchelande hoped to use this opportunity to lay down the law. The Governor and his expedition, including a company of free coloreds led by Rigaud, reached Les Cayes on July 23. And a few days later, the Governor and Rigaud and a few others promised amnesty to the slaves in exchange for standing down. But the slave fighters of Platon had already been through this with the local leaders of Les Cayes, and they wanted freedom, not just for their leadership, but for everyone. And then they also wanted better treatment for those still enslaved. So they responded to Blanchelande’s insulting amnesty offer by raiding out of their bases and burning a few more plantations to the ground. So Blanchelande said, “Right, let’s go get them.” Except he had apparently been very public about his plans, because by now he was trying to overcome serious complaints that he, like, wanted the slaves to win the revolt. So the little Kingdom of Platon knew exactly what was coming. On August 4, the Governor’s forces set out in three columns up into the mountains. But even the experienced colored troops struggled in the steep at rugged terrain. The French soldiers were just helpless. Then they all ran into a dizzying array of booby traps, and then giant boulders started getting rolled down on their heads. The expedition was as short as it was disastrous. They never had a chance. By August 8, the defeated and demoralized French soldiers straggled back into Les Cayes. Rather than being his great triumph, the battle at Platon was Blanchelande’s most humiliating defeat. A few days later, he was sailing back to Le Cap, a broken and depressed man. ",
            "Upon his return to the north, Blanchelande mailed his resignation back to the Metropole. And when the request was received, I imagine it was simply filed away someplace, because the Legislative Assembly had already sent a replacement. And Blanchelande himself was ordered to return to France to face accusations of counterrevolutionary incompetence. And just in case I forget to come back around to Blanchelande: upon his return to France, he was one of the first defendants to face the newly created Revolutionary Tribunal, that was Episode 3.28. On April 11, 1793, Blanchelande was found guilty of treason. And on April 15, he was guillotined. ",
            "Now, Governor Blanchelande actually kind of reminds me a bit of King Louis. He wasn’t a bad guy, and he would have been a fine, forgettable governor under normal circumstances. And he just got sucked into something that was way over his head. For the record, I don’t believe he was the arch mastermind of anything. ",
            "We’ll end today with what Blanchelande walked into when he got back to Le Cap, because just as the reversal of the May 15 decree had sparked a race riot in Port-au-Prince, news of the law of April 4 helped spark a race riot in Le Cap. With Blanchelande off getting trounced in Platon, it was left to the municipal authorities in Le Cap and the still whites-only Colonial Assembly to grapple with the implications of the Law of April 4, and they were resistant. When news hit in May, the Colonial Assembly said, “We will happily conform to the new law when it’s officially transmitted by the Second Commission.” And though everyone made a big show of equality when celebrating July 14, the third anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, the casual racism of daily life was a hard habit to break. On the night of August 13, mutual resentment in the city exploded. A white man went out to break up a fight between a slave man and a slave woman and in the process injured a free black man with his saber. Hearing that a white man had slashed a free black, the local free coloreds rushed to the scene, no doubt believing the very worst. The white man was arrested. But the next morning, a white woman living in the same house attempted to leave to go shopping, but she was mobbed by colored protesters. This brought out a group of whites who also no doubt believed the very worst. A street fight broke out and a free black man was killed. So the coloreds then raised the alarm and out came an armed faction of the colored militia. They marched out into Le Cap’s main street, where they were confronted by white National Guardsmen. A shooting battle erupted that left two whites dead and three wounded. Then in came the regular army soldiers from the garrison who separated the two sides. And the commandant of the garrison requested the Colonial Assembly declare martial law. But the local white authorities were like, “No, we’re not doing that.” Because they still suspected the garrison officers were secretly in league with the slave armies. But the garrison commandant did manage to keep the peace. In the wake of the incident, the white leaders offered to allow colored delegates to attend the Colonial Assembly as non-voting observers. But the coloreds were like, “No, we’re not doing that. We’re either full members or you can shove it.” But no further violence broke out as everyone waited for the Second Commission, expected to arrive at the end of September. They would presumably be empowered to settle everything and then we can all go defeat the slave uprising. ",
            "Next week, the Second Commission will indeed arrive and they will indeed set to work settling everything and then turn everyone’s attention back to the slave uprising. Except a funny thing is going to happen between now and the end of the slave revolt: the Second Commission is going to set all the slaves free. ",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "After King Louis signed the Law of April 4, which eliminated the legal basis for racial discrimination, the Legislative Assembly selected three men to sail to Saint Domingue and enforce the law. And for the record, it was in fact a law rather than simply a decree, because the King actually signed the thing. These three men would become known to history as the Second Commission because they were replacing the First Commission, the guys who had been sent over the previous fall to enforce the Decree of September the 24th that had repealed the Decree of May 15, and had itself overturned the Colonial Committee report of March 10. You follow all that? Good. I knew that you would. ",
            "Now, since the Law of April 4 had been a part of the Girondin takeover of the Royal Ministry, it is understandable that Jacques Pierre Brissot had a huge say in who the Commissioners would be, though in the end, he only got two of his top three picks. Brissot really, really wanted Julien Raimond to be one of the three Commissioners to demonstrate to the colonists in no uncertain terms that when we say race isn’t a thing anymore, we mean it. But allies of the Club Massiac inside the Legislative Assembly, and there were a few, managed to block the appointment by way of a clever deflection. To ensure the objectivity of the Commissioners, no one who owned property in the colony would be allowed to serve. This seemed like a reasonable enough restriction to the rest of the Legislative Assembly and the rule was adopted. But it was really just a way of making sure that Raimond, who obviously had extensive property holdings in Saint Domingue, was barred from serving on the Second Commission. But despite this minor setback, Brissot’s other two principal choices sailed through the nomination process, in part because they were pretty obscure and nobody knew who they were. But Brissot knew who they were and he had every confidence in the world that they would not just enforce the Law of April 4 vigorously, but bring the whole chaotic mess in Saint Domingue to a successful conclusion. These two were Léger-Félicité Sonthonax and Étienne Polverel. ",
            "Both men shared a similar career arc and a political worldview, though Polverel was 25 years older than Sonthonax. Born in Béarn in 1742, Polverel studied law in Bordeaux. He was an adherent of Enlightenment philosophy, joined the Freemasons and was an enthusiastic supporter of the revolution when it arrived. He was working in Paris as a lawyer at the time, and when the women dragged the royal family back to Paris, Polverel joined the newly formed Jacobin Club, but merely as a rank and file member. He was not a leader nor a prominent personality at all. He did, however, fall into Brissot’s orbit early and though he was not in the Friends of the Blacks, he was on record supporting colored equality. Polverel’s first really important action came in 1791 when he helped lead the charge to purge from the Jacobin Club members of the Club Massiac, who were held to be counterrevolutionary agents due to their opposition to the recently passed May 15 decree. ",
            "Polverel’s partner, Sonthonax, meanwhile, was 25 years his junior, just 29 years old when he was appointed to the Second Commission. But Sonthonax would be the junior Commissioner in age only. He is going to wind up one of the two or three most important figures in the entire Haitian Revolution, seeing as how he is the emancipator. Sonthonax was born into a wealthy but non noble provincial family and he was sent off to study law in Dijon in the early 1780s. Upon graduation, he wound up securing a coveted position in the Paris Parlement, so he had a front row seat for all the early battles of the revolution. Like Polverel, Sonthonax was not a leader, nor very well known as the revolution progressed. He too fell into Brissot’s orbit, supported racial equality and, based on an anonymous pamphlet we now know he authored, supported gradual slave emancipation, but was not in the Friends of the Blacks. He did, however, join the Jacobins and sat on the committee that issued the club’s official support for the May 15 decree. ",
            "So when the time came to select the Second Commissioners, Sonthonax and Polverel were Brissot’s ideal candidates. Neither were well known, neither carried the taint of membership in the Friends of the Blacks, but both were privately super committed to racial equality. Now, Brissot, as I just said, really wanted Julien Raimond to be the third delegate, but he couldn’t get it done. And so the Legislative Assembly appointed in his stead well, I won’t even bother confusing things by giving you the guy’s name, seeing as how he’s literally going to desert his post the first chance he gets, so we’ll just call him ‘the other guy’. ",
            "The Second Commission set sail from France at the end of July 1792 aboard a warship called the America. Also on board was a 72 year old military officer named General d’Esparbès, who had been appointed governor general to replace the disgraced Governor Blanchelande. The appointment of the positively ancient d’Esparbès is something of a historical mystery. No one quite knows how we got the job, but we don’t have to worry about it too much because on the voyage across the Atlantic, the Commissioners and d’Esparbès started budding heads immediately. As we’re about to see, they will pack up General d’Esparbès and send him back to France as soon as possible. ",
            "Also setting sail with the Commissioners were 6,000 more armed reinforcements, 2,000 regular army troops and 4,000 volunteers from the National Guard. Though France was now officially at war with both Austria and Prussia, the Legislative Assembly decided it could spare a few regiments to go put down the slave revolt. Combined with the 6,000 troops the Metropole had already sent to reinforce the First Commission and the garrison is already in the colony, the Colonial Ministry was under the impression that with these additional reinforcements on the way, there would be close to 20,000 troops in Saint Domingue, more than enough to end the revolt once and for all. ",
            "This, however, turned out to not even be close to accurate. Because, as we will see time and time again for the whole rest of the show, the first thing new European soldiers do upon arrival in Saint Domingue is get sick and die. When the Second Commission arrived, there would turn out to be only about 2,000 men actually fit for service in the colony. And of the 6,000 reinforcements they just brought with them, they would be down to 3,000 in a matter of months. ",
            "The America landed in Le Cap on either September 17 or September 20 – I’ve seen both dates reported with great conviction. They were greeted by big white leaders who were outwardly eager to work with the Commissioners. Blanchelande’s humiliating defeat at the hands of the Kingdom of Platon and the aborted race riot back in August meant that they were now ready to turn over whatever new leaf was required to bring this whole terrible business to a close, at least that’s what they said. Now the Second Commission carried with it instructions to implement three principle objectives. First, dissolve the all white assemblies and create a mixed race government for the colony. Second, end once and for all any loose talk of independence that might still be floating around out there. And third, defeat the slave uprising. And to dispel the rumors that were floating around out there, Sonthonax announced at the ceremony welcoming the commissioners to Le Cap, that they were not, repeat, not there to abolish slavery. And this was likely true. In a letter back to the Metropole these early days, Sonthonax wrote that he believed mass emancipation was inadvisable because it would lead directly to the massacre of every white in the colony. ",
            "Now, obviously the most pressing matter, though, was what to do about the slave revolt. But the commissioners were hampered right off the bat. For one, they discovered that their manpower was not nearly what they thought it was. Then they debriefed Governor Blanchelande, who had not yet gone back to France to get guillotined, and he told them that fighting slaves is not as easy as it sounds. This new information made them all a little less eager to rush into action. Then friction between the Second Commission and Governor d’Esparbès led to delays and mutual accusations that the other side was to blame for those delays. The forces at the Commission’s disposal were then given an unexpected boost just days after their arrival, when the vicomte de Rochambeau showed up with 3,000 additional troops, kind of out of the blue. ",
            "Rochambeau was the son of the comte de Rochambeau, who had served as Commander in Chief of the French Army in the American War of Independence, and who had just recently resigned his position as Commander of the Army of the North in the French Revolutionary armies. Rochambeau the Younger had just been assigned governor of the small French colony of Martinique. But counterrevolutionary royalist forces had staged a hostile takeover of the island and prevented him from landing. So let’s not get distracted by that, but just know that Rochambeau is now in Saint Domingue. ",
            "I mentioned earlier that one of the running jokes of the Haitian Revolution will be that the colony constantly has to play catch up with the rapid fire pivot of the French Revolution. Well, here we are again, because just two weeks after the Second Commission set sail with new, new instructions. What happened? That’s right. The central pivot of the whole French Revolution – the Insurrection of August 10. They missed it by just two weeks. You cannot make this stuff up. So, right on queue, two weeks after the Second Commission arrived in Le Cap, a ship came into the harbor bearing the absolutely incredible news that the King had been overthrown and France was on the verge of becoming a republic. Okay, so I guess that’s now happened. And then get this. By the time Saint Domingue heard about the Insurrection of August 10 on October 2, France had been further rocked by the invasion of the Austro-Prussian army, the panic inducing Brunswick Manifesto, the resulting September Massacres, the surprise victory at Valmy, and then the even more surprising retreat of the Austro-Prussian army. Keeping up with the French Revolution is nearly impossible.",
            "With the Insurrection of August 10 now known, however, the very legitimacy of the Second Commission hung in the air. Seeing as how their appointments came bearing the signature of a now deposed king. But confirmation of their mandate came from the Legislative Assembly very quickly. And not just confirmation, but expansion. The Second Commission now had the authority to dismiss any public official or military officer who stood in the way of their mission. On October 12, the commissioners officially dissolved the whites-only Colonial Assembly. Until a new mixed assembly could be elected, an executive committee of twelve men, called the Interim Commission, was established to act as the colony’s executive government. Six of the delegates would be chosen by the outgoing Colonial Assembly and six would be chosen by the Second Commission. And signaling that their long term commitment to racial equality might be a lot of hot air, the Colonial Assembly selected six white delegates. So to balance this, the Second Commissioners chose six colored delegates, including Julien Raimond’s brother François. ",
            "For the moment, though, the big white leaders in Le Cap were not focused on resisting racial equality. They were focused on settling old scores with the royal administration. Remember when we talked about the web of tension back in Episode 4.2, one of those lines of tension was between the small clique of royal bureaucrats and military officers whose authority had long been resented by the big whites. That hatred, as we’ve seen, has now morphed into the widespread belief that these officials were the secret hand guiding the slave uprising. Well, with news that the monarchy has now been overthrown, it is time to get rid of those guys once and for all. ",
            "So, three days after the Colonial Assembly dissolved, its delegates reformed as a private political club called the Society of the Friends of the National Convention. The following day, reports began circulating that the senior officers of the Le Cap garrison had insulted the newly arrived troops, most of whom were patriotic National Guardsmen. And then a meeting of the new club the next day turned into a mass meeting of every patriotic minded citizen in Le Cap. ",
            "On October 19, 1792, a unified patriotic front that included big whites, small whites and free coloreds, all backed by armed units from the newly arrived troops and sailors from the naval convoy, staged a huge demonstration. They had a list of 100 men who they called traitors to the country, and they wanted them all deported. Among them was the Commandant of the Le Cap garrison. He was the guy who last week had asked for martial law, but that request was denied because of the suspicion that he was in league with the slaves. Faced with this sudden mass demonstration, the Second Commission decided to side with the demonstrators, and they ordered Governor d’Esparbès to put the Commandant in custody and then prepare to deport him. But Governor d’Esparbès refused the order. Meanwhile, the commandant himself had taken refuge inside his garrison’s barracks, surrounded by loyal officers and troops. Shots were then fired as the demonstrators threatened to storm the barracks. But other military officers, well known in Le Cap but not in the Commandant circle, managed to help the Second Commission talk down both sides. The Commandant and the officers still loyal to him agreed to board a ship that would take them all back to France post haste. The Second Commission then exercise their newly expanded powers and demanded that Governor d’Esparbès, who had disobeyed a direct order, immediately resigned the governorship and himself returned to France. Having served as governor general for less than a month, d’Esparbès was already on his way home. In his place, the commissioners appointed General Rochambeau to temporarily fill the vacant position until a new new governor general was appointed. ",
            "With the crisis of October 19 resolved, the Second Commission decided to split up and attend to the colony as a whole. Sonthonax would stay in Le Cap and take care of the North Province, Polverel would take on administration of the West Province and ‘the other guy’ would take over the south. And it is right here that ‘the other guy’ truly earns his status as ‘the other guy’, because instead of going down to the South Province, he just bolts, deserts his post and disappears back to France. I dug around a little bit trying to figure out what happened to him, but he just falls off the face of the earth. So whatever. See you later, ‘other guy’. Polverel then had to take on administration of both the west and the south. And we’re going to come back to his attempt to impose the Law of April 4 onto a white population already literally up in arms about colored equality. Because the North Province, for the moment, must remain the center of attention. ",
            "The rapid fire pivots of the French Revolution did not just have implications for the free citizens of Saint Domingue, it also had huge implications for the slave armies occupying the Northern Plains. By the summer of 1791, the slave insurgents had settled into the territory they held and had faced no meaningful attempt to expel them for quite some time. Jean-François and Biassou, simultaneously partners and rivals, divided up the black held territory, with Jean-François taking the eastern part of the North Province and Biassou taking the south part. They were comfortable enough that Biassou actively enlarged an old plantation house, transforming it into something resembling a full-on royal palace. And as I mentioned last time, they also both took on grandiose military titles. Jean-François was now Grand Admiral. Biassou was Governor General, and his second in command was now Toussaint Louverture. Their followers were spread out in camps all over, with no one encampment numbering more than a few thousand. With the war stalled, these guys spent most of their time tending to and expanding the old personal plots that gave them the food that they needed to live. ",
            "Having failed to negotiate an end to the revolt the previous winter, the slave generals have now expanded their demands. There is a letter they allegedly sent, whose authority is questioned by some historians, that roots these new demands principally in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which included in its very first clause the right to resist oppression, which, they argued, is all we’re doing. But regardless of the authenticity of this specific argument, the slave demands were now nothing less than 1) general liberty and 2) general amnesty. The slave leaders recognized that plantation labor was essential to everyone’s survival. The colony was a cash crop economy that had to trade sugar, coffee and indigo to live. But when the blacks returned to work, it would be as free men paid for their labor, not as slaves. They insisted these demands be presented to King Louis and the Legislative Assembly and that the presentation be witnessed by Spanish ambassadors. But of course, by the time these demands were being made, the French monarchy had already been overthrown. ",
            "Now firmly in control of the political situation in Le Cap, or at least that’s what he thought, Sonthonax was able to turn his attention to these slaves and their demands demands that were now so couched in appeals to the King that he could paint the entire slave revolt as counterrevolutionary. He ordered Rochambeau on a coordinated offensive that ran through early November that was, on all fronts, quite successful. The slave soldiers were everywhere driven from their camps and into the mountains. But then Sonthonax and Rochambeau learned the difference between invading slave held territory and holding it without nearly enough meant to actually garrison the Northern Plains. When Rochambeau’s forces returned to Le Cap, the slaves simply came back down out of the mountains and reoccupied their old camps. And then when word filtered back up to the slaves that the King had been overthrown, the slave generals doubled down on their counterrevolutionary royalism. In early December, Biassou declared himself the King’s viceroy, who would rule in the King’s name until the monarchy was restored. ",
            "As Sonthonax learned the hard way what fighting the slave armies was really like. He was also learning that the whites in Le Cap were now practically as counterrevolutionary as the slaves. The Friends of the National Convention started making noises that “Hey, look, the Law of April 4 is great and all, but it’s also signed by a deposed king and so we’re not super convinced of its legitimacy.” Given his mandate and his powers, Sonthonax believed that it was his prerogative to simply assert that the Law of April 4 was completely legitimate and then he made sure everybody knew it. He took a very controversial and confrontational step: he appointed a free colored officer to every military unit in Le Cap. This led to angry white denunciations from inside these military units that were loudly echoed in the Friends of the National Convention, who were starting to fancy themselves as shadow government à la the Jacobins back in Paris. ",
            "But Sonthonax wasn’t having any of this. On December 1, he banned the club from holding further meetings, a decision even his colleague Polverel thought overly dictatorial. But Sonthonax pressed on. The following day, December 2, he ordered the core regiments of the regular army garrison, the still white National Guard units, and the colored militias to muster for a mass oath, swearing to uphold the Law of April 4. The colored militias showed up, obviously. The regular army regiments showed up, but were not happy about it. The white National Guard units, meanwhile, straight up ignored the order and did not come. Then, when Sonthonax ordered the men to take the oath, the coloreds did, because, of course they did, but the white soldiers refused. Then word came that a white mob was gathering on the other side of town and preparing to march on the regiment Sonthonax had mustered. With the mob approaching, Sonthonax completely lost control of the situation. Chaos set in, confusion took over, and pretty soon, shots were being fired. One of the colored regiments surrounded Sonthonax and saved his life, while the white regular army troops seized control of the central arsenal. The colored regiment, having gotten Sonthonax out of the fray alive, then fell back to the outskirts of the city. Well, actually, a bit outside the city, taking over a small settlement on the road out of town that had been fortified to prevent the slave armies from breaking in. They seized control of this critical point of the city’s defense, and by holding it, they held the fate of Le Cap in their hands. If they had wanted to, they could have opened the doors and just let the slaves in to massacre all the whites, but they didn’t. Nor did they really want to. ",
            "The coloreds held this post for three days until on December 5, 1792, Sonthonax was able to reassert control of Le Cap with the help of Rochambeau, the troops who had come over with them from France, who were still loyal, and a charismatic and well respected regular army colonel named Étienne Lavaux, who we’ll get to in a second. The colored regiment was talked into standing down, and Sonthonax furiously turned on the white agitators who had sparked the crisis, arresting most of the prominent leaders of the Friends of the National Convention and imprisoning them on ships anchored in the harbor. It was as a result of this December crisis that Sonthonax made a firm political decision: the slaves were counterrevolutionary enemies of the Republic; the whites were counterrevolutionary enemies of the Republic; the only true patriots and viable allies in the colony were the coloreds. So he made an outright alliance with the free colored leadership, putting them in charge of the municipal government of Le Cap and allowing them to form totally independent military units, staffed and led by coloreds, and answerable to no authority but Sonthonax himself. ",
            "Following the December crisis, word came in that the little royalist rebellion in Martinique had been suppressed and that Rochambeau is now free to take up his assignment. So he will now depart from our story, but only temporarily, because he will return at the very end as the second in command of the Leclerc Expedition, the massive French invasion force sent by First Consul Bonaparte in 1801 to reassert French control over Saint Domingue. With Rochambeau gone, Sonthonax elevated Colonel Étienne Lavaux to take on overall command of the colony’s military forces in the North Province. ",
            "Colonel Lavaux came from minor nobility and was a career army officer. He was considered intelligent and capable, but his only claim to fame prior to his arrival in Saint Domingue was his very willingness to go to Saint Domingue. He had volunteered his unit, the 16th Dragoons, for the expedition that was preparing to follow the Second Commission. I’m sure his men were thrilled. He was obviously an ardent revolutionary patriot and one who clearly believed in racial equality. When resistance to the idea of colored officers started up, Lavaux stood up and said, the next vacancy in the 16th Lagoons would go to a colored. This earned him the lasting friendship of Sonthonax and so, upon Rochambeau’s departure, Sonthonax happily put this obvious ally in charge of the North Province military.",
            "But that military was shrinking fast. The newly arrived European soldiers were dying like flies, and if they were going to make a move against the slaves, it was going to have to be soon. So in January 1793, Lavaux led the forces in the north on a widespread attack. They drove Viceroy Governor General Biassou from his palatial headquarters and forced him to take refuge in a nearby fort. But then Lavaux managed to get a hold of the high ground, and a company of free colored soldiers breached the walls and Biassou had to run for the safety of the mountains. At the same time, colonial forces drove Grand Admiral Jean-François from his base and over the border into Santo Domingo. This renewed offensive was also more comprehensive, and wherever the colonial forces went, they torched all the garden plots that kept the slave armies fed and then burned whatever lodgings the slaves had been using. Soon the residents of Le Cap were getting news of actual honest to God victories. After 18 months of miserable, fatalistic gloom, things were looking… up?",
            "Meanwhile, from his base down in the west, Polverel had come to the same basic conclusion as Sonthonax. And though he was less confrontational than his colleague, the dynamic turned out to be the same. The whites were going to resist the Law of April 4, and his best allies were the free coloreds. So Polverel too allied with them both against the insurgent slaves and the intransigent whites. By resisting equality, the whites were suddenly in danger, not just of having to share power with the coloreds, but being surpassed by them completely. The whites, however, were not going to go down without a fight. Polverel’s arrival in the west and his very clear preference for the coloreds led white leaders to once again seize controlled Port-au-Prince and then also Jacmel, the city on the Caribbean seaside of the southern peninsula. Polverel decided to leave that battle for another day, though, and instead turned his attention to avenging Governor Blanchelande’s defeat of the Kingdom of Platon. Since their victory, the kingdom had formed a pretty stable community up in the mountains with a network of settlements with as many as a thousand cabins, a functioning hospital, and elected kings. The increasingly prominent colored leader, André Rigaud, had remained behind in Les Cayes after Governor Blanchelande departed, and he managed to convince the local provisional assembly to offer more generous terms to the slaves freedom, not just for the leadership, but for the rank and file as well. ",
            "But even Rigaud’s more generous terms came with a heavy stipulation. With the Law of April 4 now passed, it was clear that the coloreds were the, quote, unquote, “winners” of the little civil war that had erupted. And so only those slaves who had been armed by the coloreds would have their promise of freedom recognized. Those armed by the whites would be returned to slavery because they had fought for the quote unquote “losers”. Now, some slaves took this deal because, hey, why not? But the kingdom as a whole held out. ",
            "So just as Lavaux was undertaking his offensive in the north, Polverel arrived in Les Cayes and launched a new offensive against the Kingdom of Platon, this one better organized and better executed than Blanchelande’s fiasco. When the colonial forces came marching up this time, the leaders of the kingdom determined that they were not going to be able to hold their camps and decided to retreat even higher into the mountains. Unfortunately, they had among them slaves too weak, too old, or too sick to join the quick retreat. When the colonial forces reached the settlements, they burst in unopposed and then proceeded to massacre all the blacks they found, the ones who were too weak, too old, or too sick to flee. It was a glorious victory. ",
            "So by February 1793, the slave revolt looked like it was finally going to be crushed. And everywhere, the slave armies were breaking apart and in retreat. But then what happened? That’s right. By now, the National Convention has executed King Louis, and both Britain and Spain have joined the war against France. So rather than being able to press their advantage against the slave armies, the Second Commission had to suddenly swivel to face the very real threat now posed by their colonial neighbors in Jamaica and Santo Domingo. The sudden arrival of the European war to the Caribbean had massive implications for the course of the Haitian Revolution, as both the British and Spanish looked for allies inside Saint Domingue to pry the colony out of French hands. ",
            "The Spanish, of course, looked to the slave armies that they had been covertly supplying since the fall of 1791. The Spanish government in Madrid ordered its colonial representatives in Santo Domingo to take the next step and formally recruit the French slaves into a full blown auxiliary army. The offer to Jean-François and Biassou was pretty straightforward: if you fight under the flag of the Spanish crown, we will recognize your freedom and grant you land titles when we all together inevitably crush the upstart French Republic. And the wording of this is key. The Spanish were not offering to grant the slaves their freedom. They were offering to recognize the freedom the slaves had already won for themselves. With this adroit nod to the dignity and honor of the slave fighters, and with the promise now of endless arms and supplies, Jean-François and Biassou signed up with the Spanish, bringing over 10,000 men right away with the promise of many more to come. The slave armies now fought under the flag of the Spanish Bourbons. ",
            "Meanwhile, the British looked to the bitter big whites as their best allies in the colony. White planters, who had fled to Jamaica after the start of the slave revolt, had already communicated their willingness to support a British invasion if it meant the reimposition of slavery and the recovery of all their property. While now, official representatives of the big white interest residing in London signed a formal agreement to that effect with the British Ministry. The whites would help the British invade, conquer and hold the colony, and in exchange, the British would allow them to reimpose racial apartheid and put all the blacks back in chains. ",
            "Now, for the moment, all this talk of war was just urgent rumor, but still it was clear what was coming. On February 26, Sonthonax left Le Cap in the hands of Lavaux and their colored allies and met up with Polverel in Saint-Marc on March 5 to hammer out their next move. They quickly decided that securing control of the principal port cities against the likely threat of foreign invasion would have to be the priority for the moment, and that meant pivoting from attacks on the slaves to attacks on the white holdouts. ",
            "At the beginning of April, they went on the offensive. Their first objective was Port-au-Prince, which, as I just mentioned, is of course, once again in active revolt and being held by small white agitators. Obviously, the previous round of arrest had not been thorough enough. Supported by a force of 1,200 men marching overland, the commissioners sailed the naval flotilla into the Port-au-Prince harbor on April 5 and demanded the city’s surrender. The commissioners waited until the land army was in position, and then, when the city refused to yield again, the commissioners ordered a general bombardment on April 12. Resistance collapsed at once. When the forces of the Second Commission entered the city, they did not bother trying to weed out the principal leaders from the other suspects. Hundreds of whites were indiscriminately rounded up and imprisoned on a troop transport in the harbor, to be dealt with later. Then the forces of the Second Commission went round and resecured Jacmel. By early May 1793, almost the whole of the colony had submitted to the authority of the Second Commission, either by force or by choice. The only part of the colony still held by intransigent whites was the rugged northwest tip of the southern peninsula, the Grand-Anse surrounding the port of Jérémie. This will become important once the British do invade, because Jérémie is going to be their first and most permanent beach head. ",
            "While the Second Commission was putting down the last of the whites, they were also rethinking their strategy towards the blacks. Even with the victories of January, it was painfully obvious that no true military victory was ever going to be won. As soon as the exhausted colonial forces moved on from whatever territory they had just cleared, the slaves simply came back down out of the mountains and retook it. The policy of winning the war and then imposing a settlement was never going to work. Sonthonax had already written back to France urging them that the time had come to, quote, “do something for the slaves”, but he received no reply. Not only was the government a little busy, what with it being the spring of 1793 and all, but with the British navy now out on patrol in the Atlantic, communications between Saint Domingue and the Metropole were all but severed. ",
            "Left on their own, Sonthonax and Polverel decided to unilaterally issue a decree on May 5, 1793. The core of the decree reaffirmed both the Code Noir and the Royal Decrees of 1784 and 1785, that the masters had an obligation to provide for the slaves, but there were limits to how badly slaves could be treated, and that if masters mistreated their slaves, that slaves would have the right to appeal to authorities. But the content of this decree, while obviously hated by the master class, was not nearly as offensive as the means by which it was disseminated. Aware that the previous slave protections had been ignored by the colonists, the Second Commission had the decree translated into Creole and then ordered it read aloud on every plantation and transmitted to the slave insurgents. So not only would the slaves have rights, they would all know that they had rights. The Commissioners hoped that this would start the process of coaxing the slaves back to the plantations. ",
            "Luckily for everyone, just two days after the May 5 decree was issued, General François-Thomas Galbaud, the new new governor general appointed by the National Convention, arrived in Le Cap, and everything got upended again. As soon as Galbaud landed, he was treated to a thousand horror stories by prominent whites in Le Cap about the horror of life under the horrible Commissioners who had been appointed by a horrible King, and how, thank God, a true patriotic representative of the Republic is here to save us from the horrible horror. Galbaud took a liking to all this fawning attention, but still he exchanged a few cordial letters with the Second Commissioner saying, “I’m here I look forward to meeting with you and coordinating strategy, et cetera, et cetera.” To which the Second Commission cordially replied, “Oh, we’re so glad to have you and look forward to working with you, but please, the situation here is very complex. Don’t be misled by enemies of the Republic. And whatever you do, take no official action until we are back in Le Cap and we can confer in person.”",
            "Next week, Governor General Galbaud is totally going to take official action before the Second Commission returns to Le Cap. And when Sonthonax and Polverel do arrive, the resulting political confrontation will lead to nothing less than the total destruction of Le Cap and the mass emancipation of every slave in Saint Domingue.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "In the eight months that the Second Commission had been in Saint Domingue, they had faced both unbeatable slave armies and stubborn whites who believed that if they held out just a little bit longer, things would go back to the way they were in the good old days. But by May 1793, the commissioners kind of sort of did have a handle on things. The whites had mostly submitted and they had just unveiled a new, more lenient approach to ending the slave revolt. But then, on May 7, 1793, the new Governor General François-Thomas Galbaud arrived. Within six weeks of stepping off the boat, Galbaud would help bring about the end of white rule in Saint Domingue, the total destruction of Le Cap and the emancipation of all the slaves. It really is quite an impressive resume.",
            "Now the just flat out weird part about the intersection of the Haitian and French Revolutions is the complete lack of care with which the French revolutionaries chose their colonial Governor General. Saint Domingue was their most lucrative colony, a true moneymaking engine at a time when France was desperately short of cash. It was currently being rocked by a slave revolt and a civil war. So you’d think that they’d take some care in selecting the Governor General of what was sure to be a mission of vital national importance. But after Blanchelande, they sent 72 year old d’Esparbès, who no one has ever heard of and who no one today understands how he even got the job. And now they’re sending General Galbaud, who… Well, let me tell you all about this.",
            "General François-Thomas Galbaud was a tiny little man, like, maybe 5ft tall. He came from a noble provincial family that had long been absentee owners of two plantations in Saint Domingue, one in the West Province and one down in the south. Galbaud himself was a career army officer who had lethargically advanced through the ranks of the Ancien Régime military. He had fought in the American War of Independence and had reached the rank of Captain on the eve of the Revolution. But that’s it. Galbaud was a patriotic liberal, though, and in 1790 joined the local Jacobin Club when it opened in Strasbourg, where he was stationed. When the war started in 1792, he wound up attached to General Dumouriez’s staff and had then been present for the great victory at Valmy. But he really got everyone’s attention when he unexpectedly found himself in a face-to-face meeting with the Duke of Brunswick during the final stages of the allied retreat following Valmy. His alleged and very self reported tough talk to the commander in chief of the enemy was written up and publicized in the Paris papers. So in the fall of 1792, Galbaud had generated a little revolutionary notoriety for himself. ",
            "So in November 1792, the National Convention was looking for a new Governor of Martinique, because, remember, from last week, General Rochambeau had apparently moved on to Saint Domingue. So they said, “All right, let’s go with this Galbaud guy. He seems like a patriotic officer.” And he really was. But as Galbaud prepared to take over Martinique, the National Convention found out in March 1793 that Rochambeau had gone and taken up his original post. And so they told Galbaud, “Look, why don’t you just go on to Saint Domingue, since they don’t have a Governor General and you’re already packed and everything?” I mean, this is crazy. This is a really important job to just be handing off to people kind of as an afterthought. Now, of course, France is at war at this point, and no one with any juice is going to let themselves get sent to Saint Domingue to be killed by slave rebels or yellow fever. But still, they were acting pretty cavalier about this appointment. And on top of everything else, by the time Galbaud set sail in March, war with Britain and Spain had already been declared, and the defense of Saint Domingue was going to be a thing. Anyway, I will stop belaboring this point. You get the idea. They were pretty nonchalant about all this. ",
            "Now, as I mentioned at the very end of last week’s show, as soon as Galbaud stepped off the boat in Le Cap, he was set upon by prominent big whites begging him to do something about these damned commissioners. Galbaud and his wife, who was with him and who was also pretty stoked to have married a dull career captain, who was now suddenly Governor General of Saint Domingue, enjoyed the attention but Galbaud was an ardent Republican patriot, and one thing he made clear was that, “Look, I’ll look into your various grievances, but I support the Law of April 4, and I plan to enforce it.” But he also told the free colored allies of the Second Commission, “We’re all in this together, fellow citizens. Equality, remember? No one is superior to anyone else.” ",
            "Now, this all sounded good and neutral, and Galbaud emphasized all this when he exchanged letters with Sonthonax and Polverel, who were down in the West Province. But this set off some alarm bells, and they told him, “Don’t do anything until we get there!” All this talk of unity and equality sounded like Galbaud was about to re-empower their white enemies in Le Cap. “So this is a tricky business”, they said. “You don’t know what it’s like here, so just don’t do anything.”",
            "But Galbaud refused to wait around for the Second Commissioners. The residents of the city were complaining about a lack of basic supplies. The merchants in the harbor were complaining that no one was paying them for their goods. The soldiers were complaining that they hadn’t been paid at all. Galbaud set to work trying to orchestrate a complicated little barter, swap, and IOU plan to unclog the wheels of commerce. But he couldn’t get everyone on board. And very troubling to the free coloreds was who he did not even invite on board: the free coloreds. Because despite Galbaud’s rhetoric, he was still casually referring to them as mulattos, now an insulting label, and just didn’t invite them to any of his meetings or take their counsel on anything. And his wife refused to entertain any black or colored, quote unquote, “concubine” in her home. So the colored started writing frantic letters to the Second Commissioners saying, “You need to get back here right now.” ",
            "Sonthonax and Polverel arrived back in Le Cap on June 10, and they did not bring with them any pretense of cordiality. They were not at all happy with Galbaud’s spunky initiative, especially since it was clear he was listening mostly to the very white leaders they had just spent the last eight months making enemies of. And the reports of Lady Galbaud’s treatment of colored women might have been particularly off putting. By now, both Sonthonax and Polverel had taken up with colored mistresses. Sonthonax would soon enough be marrying his. At an impromptu welcoming gathering at the edge of town, Galbaud invited the commissioners to dine with him that evening, but Sonthonax bluntly said, “We’re tired, and we’ve already promised to dine with our friends.” And off they went. ",
            "The next day, this calculated slight opened up into a permanent breach. In their first official meeting, Sonthonax and Polverel confronted Galbaud with the reports they had gotten from their friends in the city. They told them, “Look, you can’t trust the whites. They will say anything to undermine the Law of April 4. You can only trust the coloreds.” But they also told him, “It doesn’t really matter. We are here now, and all we really need from you is obedience. So just do what you’re told, and everything will be fine.” ",
            "Now, Galbaud’s orders very clearly said that the Second Commission was the supreme authority in Saint Domingue. And he said, “That’s fine. I’ll follow you every order as long as it’s in accordance with the law.” ",
            "And they said, “No, we are the law. You do what we say. We’ve tried persuasion with these people. We’ve tried appeals to patriotism. The only thing holding this place together is our supreme authority.” ",
            "Galbaud refused to concede this point. Then the commissioners said, “Oh, also by the way, you shouldn’t even be here, thanks to that law that says property holders can’t hold office in Saint Domingue.” ",
            "Galbaud said, “I asked the Ministry if it was okay, and they never got back to me, but if you want to send me home over – fine.” ",
            "And then the commissioners said, “Fine.”",
            "And that was pretty much that. The Second Commissioners put Galbaud on a long boat that rode him back to his ship, where he would await deportation. ",
            "But that brings us to the most pissed off people in all of Le Cap in June 1793: the sailors, both of the merchant and naval variety. In the immediate aftermath of the initial slave uprising, Governor Blanchelande had closed the harbor. But once things settled into a stalemate, those restrictions had loosened. But with a declaration of war with Britain looming in early March, the Second Commissioners had ordered the harbor closed once again, and it had remained closed ever since. No ship had been allowed to leave Saint Domingue in over three months, and the sailors were getting really super restless. On top of that, in April, plans had been laid for a mass convoy to set sail, merchant ships protected by warships that would hopefully be able to repel a British attack. Close to 50 additional ships from across the colony had massed in the Le Cap harbor on May 10 in preparation for the convoy, but the order to launch never came. So there were now over 100 ships in the harbor bobbing along, doing nothing for a solid month. And some of those ships held on board the white leaders who had been imprisoned in the aftermath of the December crisis. And those guys had no trouble stirring up additional resentment against the Second Commission. ",
            "Now, the other issue is that the sailors and the coloreds in Le Cap had come to hate each other. That’s the standard relationship between small whites and free coloreds. When the sailors came ashore, they usually caroused around and got drunk and picked fights with the coloreds, and with both Sonthonax and Polverel down in the west trying to assert control over the rest of the colony, the sailors had been getting away with this for quite a while. Now that the Second Commission was back, however, the coloreds were able to start flexing their muscles a bit, maybe even strutting around a bit. On June 16, a few days after Galbaud had allowed himself to be put on a boat, a bunch of sailors were in Le Cap and apparently there was a lot of harassment and cat calling by the coloreds. Fights had broken out, and when the sailors got back to their ships, they complained to the Admiral of the fleet.",
            "On the evening of June 19, the Admiral decided to pay a formal visit to the commissioners to lodge a complaint about the way his men had been treated. What he walked into was a little party of about 100 men and women, the commissioners, their free colored allies and white friends. And there were a few, most of them with black or colored wives. They appeared to be celebrating the triumph over Governor Galbaud and the reburying of the whites. The admiral lodged his complaint and then went back to the flagship. But when he got there, he found the men in a very agitated state and not happy that he hadn’t pressed their complaints further. And then somebody had a bright idea. They said, “We have amongst us the Governor General of the colony, the supreme head of all the military forces. He has been shabbily treated by these outrageous, half breed loving despots.” So they turned to Galbaud and said, “Man, do we have an idea for you. Instead of going back to France, why don’t we all go arrest the commissioners and send them back to France?” Galbaud was at first reluctant to go along with this, but over the night of June 19, he was persuaded, particularly by his wife and brother, who were both on the ship with him. ",
            "Early the next morning, longboats crisscrossed amongst the ships as word spread of the planned action. Galbaud himself made personal appeals to the sailors, appeals that on every ship, bypassed the officers and were made straight to the men. The common sailors enthusiastically cried, “Long live the Republic!” and “Long live Galbaud!”. And they agreed to fight for him. The officers were either ignored by the stirred up men or got locked in their staterooms, as, for example, was the fate of the senior Admiral, who was imprisoned on his flagship. By the afternoon, the citizens of Le Cap witnessed an incredible and incredibly terrifying sight. The gunship slowly turned their broadsides to face the city. Every gun in the fleet was now pointed at Le Cap. Sonthonax and Polverel were alerted and they scrambled to assemble a force of loyal men for whatever might come next. Free colored militiamen were their best option, but initially there was only about 50 of them around. Now they had some regular troops they could count on, in particular, Colonel Lavaux’s 16th Dragoons. But the rest were suspect. If it came down to it, who would they fight for? Then the commissioners hunkered down in the Government House, the largest building in Le Cap that functioned as an all-purpose city hall. At 4:00 p.m. on June 20, 1793, Galbaud led the first wave of sailors from ship to shore. They landed without opposition. They also landed without being welcomed. The vast majority of the population were closing up their windows, locking their doors, and trying to stay out of it, like townspeople preparing for the climactic shootout at the end of a western. Now, it’s unclear how many men Galbaud actually landed with. Reports range from 600 minimum to 2,000 maximum, but the lower number seems way more plausible. But from the moment they landed, Galbaud’s lack of a plan and lack of resolve and lack of real leadership skills became apparent. The motley array of undisciplined sailors just marched up towards the Government House as a headless mob, with Galbaud trailing behind. A detachment broke off to go talk their way into the arsenal to get some heavy guns. But when they got there, they discovered colored militiamen were defending it, and the white commanding officer refused to open the door. ",
            "The rest of the sailors, meanwhile, approached the Government House, but along the way, they started getting picked off by unexpected sniper fire from the windows, which they had not expected, nor were they prepared for. And then when they hit the Government House itself, they tried to push their way in and found a well trained company of coloreds had set up a strong defensive line in the garden in front of the building. This company was led by an African born ex slave and now free black, named Jean-Baptiste Belley, whose name I want you to remember. Belley’s men drove the sailors back after a fierce little firefight. But believing, rightly, that they were ultimately outnumbered, the Second Commission and their men fell back out of the Government House into some adjacent barracks behind the building. Galbaud now finally caught up with the men he was, quote unquote, “leading”, divided them up into three columns to go around the Government House and attack the barracks. But the column going around the north side got bogged down by sniper fire, and his own column in the center remained weirdly inert in front of the Government House. So only the column that swung around the south, led by Galbaud’s brother, actually got to the barracks. But the forces of the Second Commission noticed how isolated this column was, launched a quick attack, most of the sailors ran off, and Galbaud’s brother was captured. ",
            "So two hours after landing, Galbaud’s little expedition was in disarray, and he retreated back towards the harbor. With a small force, Galbaud himself wound up back in front of the arsenal. He demanded its surrender, and when they refused, he was just totally flummoxed. One of his men asked what the problem was, and Galbaud said, “I told them to surrender, and they won’t.” So the guy was like, “Well, let’s go take it, sir.” But Galbaud didn’t really have that killer instinct, so he went back to talking, and eventually he convinced the arsenal commander to stand down, in part due to the commander’s fear that if he didn’t, those ships out in the harbor would open up their guns, and the arsenal would be the primary target. But then Galbaud did, in fact, send an order back to the ships to open fire on the city to force the Second Commissioners to give it up. But when this order got back to the ships, all the officers, who were not in on this little adventure, folded their arms and said, “No, we are not doing that at all”. And the sailors left behind, while likely supporters of the adventure, were not the hottest of the hotheads – all those guys were now ashore. So the ships did not fire their guns, nor would they ever. ",
            "As night fell, Le Cap descended into a lawless free for all. With a quick victory no longer in the offing, the sailors under Galbaud’s quote unquote “command” turned to a little good old fashioned looting. Then, with the white authorities trying to kill each other and the civilian masters all cowering in the corner, the thousands and thousands of urban slaves recognized that this might be their day of liberty. They left their homes and joined aimlessly roving bands of black slaves and white sailors looting and pillaging. And whenever these groups ran into each other, they started fighting and killing each other. It was a long, brutal night in Le Cap.",
            "Adding to the slave’s willingness to walk away from their masters was the rumor going round that the Second Commission, still holed up in the barracks, were issuing some kind of general liberty. And this was true! Kind of. Realizing that they did not have enough men to actually defend their position, they turned to the expedient both the whites and coloreds had turned to while fighting their little civil war in the west and south provinces: arm the slaves. So they said, we’ll give freedom to any slave who comes and fights for us. And after the long night of anarchy ended, a broad sheet to that effect started making the rounds. The official terms were: join our army and agree to stay under arms until all the enemies of the Republic, foreign and domestic, are defeated, and we will make you free citizens. Now, this implied service not just against Galbaud, but also against any possible invasion by the British or Spanish, and also against the insurgent slave armies occupying the Northern Plains. But even with these terms, slaves started signing up, which is how this whole batch of guys become known, somewhat erroneously, as the Citizens of June 20. ",
            "By the morning of the 21st, Galbaud had secured some heavy guns from the arsenal and positioned them against the government house. Sonthonax and Polverel determined the barracks were now indefensible and decided to make a run for it, heading for that same little fortified settlement that the colored militia had captured during the crisis back in December. From there, they took their next momentous step, they sent out envoys to contact the insurgents occupying camps near Le Cap and offer them the same deal: freedom for service. Eventually, two leaders came down to parlay. The senior one was named Pierrot, but ultimately the more important one was a guy named Macaya. They dickered with the Second Commissioners and then accepted the deal, bringing with them 2,000 followers. And now the Second Commission had an army it could really fight back with. ",
            "Hilariously enough, though, by that point, midday on June 21, there was no one actually to fight back against. The imagination of Galbaud, his sailors and the entire white population of Le Cap had run away with them after the Second Commission split. While Sonthonax and Polverel were trying to get slaves to join them, the people in Le Cap thought it was already a done deal and that right now, this second, a slave army is marching to massacre us all. Panic swept everyone away. Galbaud himself, like, ran back to the harbor and plunged into the water, trying to get on a boat to carry him back to the ships. His men, understandably, followed close at his heels. And then the white residents saw the Governor General and his men running away and said, “Oh God, we have to get out of here.” Every prominent big white family made a run for it. They gathered what they could carry and then booked it for the shore, desperately trying to get on board a boat that would take them to the ships that would save them from certain death. The harbor was all yelling and crying and pushing and shoving. Meanwhile, the Second Commissioners and their forces were back at their base, getting ready for what they thought was a certain attack. ",
            "Now, as usually happens in these situations, and all the panic and looting which was now widespread and indiscriminate, a fire broke out. Down the road, Galbaud would blame the Second Commission for deliberately setting it, but that’s obviously not true. The Second Commission would in turn blame Galbaud, but that doesn’t seem likely either. Most likely it was an accident. But whoever caused it, the fire spread rapidly. So now the looting and the panicked fleeing picked up to a crazy speed. Every ship in the harbor was soon loaded with white refugees, including every prominent big white family. The citizens who could not make it onto the ships had fled to the surrounding countryside as Le Cap itself continued to burn. ",
            "So it wasn’t until the following day, June 22, that the slave fighters enrolled by Sonthonax and Polverel actually arrived on the scene in Le Cap. They had marched in thinking they were going to war. What they found instead was a deserted city in flames. There would be no war. So of course, these guys started pillaging what they could before the whole city burned to the ground. Over that night of the 22nd, there was an immense pressure put on the ship captains to get the hell out of there. But there was a problem. They still lacked the formal authority to do so. But after further cajoling and the recognition that the chaos and destruction and danger were so complete that they could justify it, the Admiral agreed to sail away the next day. By June 24, the harbor, that had just been overcrowded with 100 ships, was nearly empty. This mass exodus of the big whites represents the end of white colonial rule in Saint Domingue. They had all held out in the hopes of getting back everything, and instead they sailed away with nothing. Now, we’ll follow up with this lot next week, as good old Citizen Genêt is going to make a cameo appearance. So for now, we’re going to stay behind in Saint Domingue. ",
            "Cap-Français. Good old Le Cap. The Paris of the Antilles was now a fiery ghost town littered with dead bodies. The final summation of the destruction runs that about 85% of the city was consumed by fire. Though I must point out that with so much of the city constructed of stone and brick, this is not like the city is just a flat bed of ashes. The death toll runs from a low of about 1,200 estimated by Colonel Lavaux, to the 3,000 estimated by the Second Commissioners, and the highs run to 7,500 and even 10,000. Those numbers provided by various eyewitnesses who were very hostile to both the slaves and the Second Commissioners. Whatever the final numbers, what had just happened in Le Cap in June 1793 was a cataclysmic disaster. ",
            "Sonthonax and Polverel, meanwhile, now had to try to pick up the pieces. And there was now a whole new balance of power to reckon with: the Citizens of April 4 and the Citizens of June 20, who now actually outnumbered the free coloreds and the forces of the Second Commission. There was no way to hold on to the colony for France unless the commissioners kept the Citizens of June the 20th firmly on their side. This was highlighted especially when they sent Macaya off to make contact with Jean-François and Biassou and offer them the Freedom for Service deal. But on their behalf, Toussaint issued a sharp response that the slave leaders would, quote, “never negotiate with the Second Commission, whose authority they do not recognize. They can add that having fought up to you now alongside their brothers to uphold the right of the king, they will all shed the last drop of their blood to defend the Bourbons, to whom they have promised unswavering loyalty to the death.” End quote. And then Macaya himself went back over to the slave insurgency. ",
            "Now, the reason the slave generals rebuffed the offer of the Second Commission is not that hard to guess. Not only were they offering less than the Spanish had offered, but they were in a far weaker position, because where are we right now? That’s right. It’s the summer of 1793, when the European alliance arrayed against the French Republic was in wait-for-them-to-collapse mode. The Vendée had erupted. The federalist revolt was in full swing. France was surrounded on all sides. It was broke. It was tearing itself apart. The Spanish were feeding all this information to Jean-François and Biassou and saying that the promises of the representatives of the French Republic are meaningless. Their government is not going to last the year. The violent destruction of Le Cap only confirmed the general feeling that the French were losing badly everywhere. ",
            "Now, one thing I’ve not ever seen is a good explanation for why the slave armies didn’t fall on the Second Commissioners right then. But it’s likely that following the lead of their Spanish superiors, that wait-and-let-them-collapse-without-wasting-our-own-lives-and-treasure was the order of the day in the mountains of Saint Domingue, no less than the Belgian frontier. With the slaves electing to stick with the Spanish. Pierrot, the one leader who had come over to the Second Commission, started telling them, “Look, you guys are going to have to do a lot better than the original terms of service if you want us to stick around. Like, for example, we have wives and children and we want freedom for them. Now.” ",
            "Given the circumstances, Sonthonax and Polverel had little choice. On July 11, they extended freedom to the wives and children of the men who would join their army. But Pierrot also strongly hinted that in the end, nothing less than general liberty was going to get the job done. If the commissioners wanted to salvage French rule, they had better do it sooner rather than later. ",
            "At the end of July, now a month removed from the Battle of Le Cap, the situation seemed just stable enough to allow Polverel to return to the West Province to ensure that the rest of the colony did not descend into its own chaos. Because just as Le Cap was burning to the ground, André Rigaud had led an armed expedition to go try to capture Jérémie. But the expedition had failed. But the whites wound up being the least of Polverel’s concern, because not only did he have to worry about renewed slave unrest, but also anti-complaints from his colored allies about the possibility of total emancipation. Polverel insisted that this was not his objective, nor did the commission have a mandate to do it. But then, up in the North Province, his colleague Sonthonax, well, Sonthonax, just went for it. ",
            "Sonthonax had come to Saint Domingue personally opposed to slavery, but not intending to abolish it. After six months of experience in the colony, he had concluded that defeating the slaves was impossible. And so he and Polverel had issued that decree on May 5, promising slaves better treatment if they laid down their arms then. The Battle of Le Cap had forced him, by pure necessity of war, to free thousands of slaves to fight for him, and then their families. Now unable to coax the slave armies down with the promise of freedom for service, there was only one step left to take. And at that moment, he believed if he did not take it, it would be the end of the French in Saint Domingue. At a public banquet on August 25, he accepted a petition from 600 of the Citizens of June 20 requesting general liberty. And he said, “Let me think about it.” ",
            "On August 29, 1793, Sonthonax issued an eight page general emancipation decree that opened with the words of the Declaration of the Rights of Man: “Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.” But the decree was not without major caveats, because he went on to say, “Do not believe, however, that the liberty you are going to enjoy is a state of sloth and idleness. In France, everyone is free and everyone works.” After ordering the mass dissemination of the Declaration of the Rights of Man in Article One, Article Two then read:",
            "“All Negroes and people of mixed blood currently enslaved are declared free and will enjoy all rights pertaining to French citizenship. They will, however, be subject to a regimen described in the following articles […]”, ",
            "And what followed were over 30 articles describing that regimen. The word and legal category of slave was banished forever, but the ex-slaves would now be called ‘cultivators’, who must remain attached to their current plantation for at least a year. They would qualify for a kind of elaborate profit sharing mechanism that kept the inequality of the old slave hierarchy in place, with drivers, now recast as ‘foremen’, making more than cultivators and women making two-thirds what the men made. So this was freedom, kind of. ",
            "The dilemma Sonthonax was facing was a dilemma that every leader of Saint Domingue and then every leader of independent Haiti would face: how to maintain a profitable export economy that required forced slave labor, after all the slaves had been freed. Because this might come as a shock, but once they were free, many slaves did not want to go back to work cutting piling and boiling sugar day after day, forever. They wanted actual liberty. This dilemma is going to play a big part of the story once Toussaint Louverture comes to power. And though it was a particularly unfree form of freedom, it was no longer slavery. Slavery was dead in Saint Domingue, and not even Napoleon Bonaparte would be able to reimpose it. For the first time, a major slaveholding power had issued a general emancipation of its slaves. ",
            "When President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, also under wartime duress, he was coming up on the 70th anniversary of Sonthonax’s decree. It also came just about six months after the United States finally decided to recognize Haiti, because all the southern leaders who had blocked recognition and fear of giving their own slaves ideas weren’t around to block recognition anymore. But we’ll talk about that at the very end of our series. ",
            "When Polverel found out about his colleague’s unilateral mass emancipation decree, he was furious. Not because he wasn’t sympathetic, but because, for one, he hadn’t been consulted at all about this. And for another, Polverel’s situation in the west was different from the situation in the north. In the north, the mass flight of the whites had left the limited number of free coloreds open to emancipation, because we have to do something. But down in the west, there was still a very strong and very stable colored elite opposed to emancipation. And in the west, the plantations had never been destroyed. The slaves who had fought under Hyacinthe, for example, had returned to work as slaves. So Sonthonax’s decree was really going to mess up a not terrible situation here. I mean, not terrible from the free coloreds’ perspective. But with the genie out of the bottle, Polverel did not believe he could lag too far behind. So he sent an angry letter to Sonthonax that basically said, “What the hell, man?” And then proceeded on his own course of emancipation. His decrees and accompanying caveats were even more elaborate than Sonthonax’s. But the thrust was the same. The slaves would be emancipated, yes, but they would have to stay on their plantations and keep working. Liberty could not just mean liberty to do anything you wanted, because that would be the death of the colony. ",
            "In many ways, the emancipation of the slaves caused as many problems as they solved. It may be prevented more slaves from deserting to the insurgent armies, but it did nothing to bring in the tens of thousands already under arms. As Toussaint said in a statement, quote, “As long as God gives us the force and the means, we will acquire another liberty different from that which you tyrants pretend to impose on us.” And now the coloreds were themselves becoming estranged from the commissioners, who were now giving pride of place to the Citizens of June the 20th rather than the Citizens of April 4. They were now seeing their moment of triumph, the expulsion of all the big whites turned into the undoing of a world that they now hope to rule. And they did not like that Sonthonax were saying things like, citizens must remember that liberty comes before equality.",
            "But despite all of this and the fact that things were going to get a lot worse for Sonthonax and Polverel before they got better, in September, Sonthonax tried to put a happy face on the disastrous summer of 1793 and defend mass emancipation with a bold PR move. He selected three men, one white, one colored, and one black, to sail back to France to tell the National Convention that the revolution had fully and truly come to Saint Domingue, and that it would be a better and stronger Saint Domingue that would emerge. Of course, by the time this commission, cleverly dubbed the Tricolor Commission, finally made it to Paris, Saint Domingue was not stronger and better than ever. It would actually be mostly an occupied country, because next week, the British will be invited by the hold out whites in Jérémie to sail on into the harbor and set up a base. Shortly thereafter, embittered Coloreds will invite the British into Saint-Marc, and pretty soon, the British will occupy most of the ports in the west and south provinces. Meanwhile, up in the north, zero progress will have been made against the Spanish backed slave armies who still held the lion’s share of the province. And then, of course, back in France, the great patron of the Second Commissioners, Brissot and Girondin allies, they’ve already been purged from the National Convention and are about to get executed. So the recall order to Sonthonax and Polverel is on its way. So, yes, things are going to get worse for them before they get better.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "As the Second Commission approached the first anniversary of their arrival in Saint Domingue, it’s fair to say that they had shepherded the colonial crisis from mere revolt to full blown revolution. Remember, when they had shown up, the whites were still attempting to both deny colored equality and make no concessions whatsoever to the slaves. The Second Commission had not only imposed racial equality by force, they had now gone and freed all the slaves. Not that many whites were around anymore. The mass exodus from Le Cap in June was just the start of a larger exodus. The whole rest of the summer of 1793, whites just got on boats and sailed away. But the question now circulating through the entire Atlantic world was, hey, what the hell just happened in Saint Domingue? And is any of it going to be permanent? ",
            "Now, one of the major concerns Sonthonax and Polverel now had was how this was all going to play back in France. They were acutely aware that the men and women they had either actively deported or who had just fled the colony in terror were going to paint a very negative picture of their conduct. And then they became really super concerned when word finally trickled back to the colony about what had happened in Paris in June of 1793, which was, you guessed it, the purge of the Girondins. About three weeks before the destruction of Le Cap, the Sans-culottes in Paris had demanded the expulsion of Brissot and all his friends from the National Convention, and Brissot was the political patron of Sonthonax and Polverel. Even if all they had done upon arrival in Saint Domingue was plant a nice flower garden, their lives and fortunes might at this very moment be in jeopardy. And they had obviously done a hell of a lot more than plant a flower garden since their arrival. ",
            "In mid-September, they got their first unofficial notice of their worst fear. On July 16, 1793, before news of the destruction of Le Cap had even gotten back home, the National Convention voted to recall Sonthonax and Polverel and make them stand before the Revolutionary Tribunal. The commissioners understandably decided to stay in Saint Domingue until an official emissary brought them a written order to depart. They claimed this was to supervise the continued defense of the colony from the Spanish and British until replacement leaders arrived. But when the Revolutionary Tribunal calls, a little foot dragging is not exactly irrational, especially because by now they knew that ex Governor Blanchelande had been executed for far less than anything they had done. So they elected to wait for an actual order. ",
            "And they weren’t just blowing smoke when they said they couldn’t leave without replacement leaders being in place, because with all the chaos and resentment inside Saint Domingue, the British finally decided to make their play for the colony. In mid-September, word came round that the whites in Jérémie had invited a British naval squadron into their harbor and 600 British soldiers had disembarked. At almost that same moment, regular army forces stationed at a naval base at Môle-Saint-Nicolas on the northwest tip of the North Province, surrendered to the British without firing a shot. The British invasion of Saint Domingue had begun. ",
            "Just as the British were invading Sonthonax, and what was left of his little interim commission selected six men to go back to France and defend everything that had happened over the last year. And the very character of the commission would speak volumes. There would be two whites, two coloreds and two blacks – living proof of liberty, equality and fraternity. Now, only three of these guys are actually going to make it Paris, so they’re the ones I’m going to focus on. The white delegate was named Louis-Pierre Dufay. He was a lapsed aristocrat who had been an early white supporter of the commissioners in Le Cap. He had been one of the guys, for example, writing frantic letters back to them right after Governor Galbaud arrived. The colored delegate was named Jean-Baptiste Mills, about whom I can find almost no information except that he was the colored representative in the Tricolored Commission, but presumably he was a landowner and probably an officer in the free colored militia. The black representative we met last week, Jean-Baptiste Belley, the guy who had led the defense of the commissioners at the Government House during the Battle of Le Cap. Born in Africa, brought to Saint Domingue as a slave, and then later emancipated, Belley’s role in all of this is going to be particularly groundbreaking, as he’s about to be the first black ex slave to do, well, everything he’s about to do. ",
            "After the Tricolor Commission set sail, they did not head straight for France. Instead, they headed up to the United States, which meant that the first thing the Tricolor Commission got to do was run into all the refugees who had fled Le Cap back in June and those people, oh my God, they were so mad. It’s estimated that about 3,000 to 5,000 residents of Saint Domingue fled in the June exodus. Since none of the ships in Le Cap had been prepared to suddenly be ferrying all of these civilian refugees, I mean, it’s not like they had provisions or accommodations for all these people, they decided to sell them all up to the United States, the only country France wasn’t at war with and just deposit them there. So that’s what happened to all the refugees. Major disembarkings occurred in Charleston and Norfolk, Baltimore and Philadelphia. Now, the response from the Americans was welcoming and generous and benevolent societies were established to help the utterly destitute French refugees land on their feet. As I said, the Americans had been following events in Saint Domingue in the papers and were understandably sympathetic to the plight of the refugees. Well, most of them. Because while two-thirds of the refugees were white, the other third were either black or colored, both free or slave. Now, almost all of the blacks and coloreds were women and they came in two principal types. They were either wives of white refugees or they were slaves who acted as nannies and caregivers for the various white children. But there were also a few men, both slave and free, in the bunch. And so along with the general fraternal embrace of the refugees there was quite a lot of hand wringing that some of these blacks and coloreds might have boarded the boats in Le Cap intending to spread the gospel of slave revolt in the United States. But proposals to try to limit disembarkings to only whites got nowhere as angry French refugees barked in French that either this is my wife or this is the woman who was raising my children. So the blacks and coloreds got off the boat with the whites and rumors of a planned uprising, particularly around Richmond, Virginia, were thick in the air. Without really having much experience with free coloreds, for example, the Americans couldn’t quite believe that these colored refugees were enemies of the slave insurgents, not their allies. ",
            "But when nothing actually ever happened, the Americans tried to figure out what to do with the refugees. Working through all of this with the American government and various local authorities was the French ambassador to the United States, our old friend, Citizen Genêt. When he wasn’t driving George Washington up the wall, Genêt worked on the refugee problem and it soon became clear that they fell into three types: those who planned to go back to Saint Domingue, those who wanted to go back to France, and those who were prepared to try to start a new life in the United States. And what with the whole world being an exploded mess of war, revolt, and destruction. For the most part, they all just had to sit tight and live on American charity for a while. It’s also worth mentioning that in the late summer of 1793, Philadelphia was stricken by a pretty catastrophic epidemic of yellow fever. And while you can never be 100% sure of these things, the most likely explanation is that the epidemic came along with the refugees, so that also happened. ",
            "Citizen Genêt was a side character in the story of the French Revolution, but he winds up playing a critical supporting role in the story of the Haitian Revolution, because, if you remember, Genêt was, that’s right, in the Brissot-Girondin faction. That’s why he had been appointed ambassador to the United States in the first place. So though he did not know Sonthonax and Polverel personally, they had been in regular correspondence with each other all through 1793 and pretty much saw eye to eye on politics. So when the warship bearing the deposed Governor Galbaud arrived in Philadelphia, the deposed governor, like every other refugee, spun a tale of horror about the conduct of the Second Commissioners and how they had destroyed Le Cap and Genêt said, “Yeah, I don’t buy it. I’m pretty sure this is all your fault.” Genêt said, “I’m going to keep your mutinous soldiers here in the United States, but I’m going to send you back to France to face the music.” ",
            "Galbaud and the sailors both strenuously objected to this because they did not want to be separated from each other. Galbaud needed the sailors as witnesses to back up his story, and the sailors needed Galbaud to say, “Yes, I was in charge the whole time.”, so they refused to be separated. Then Genêt found out that Galbaud, the sailors and civilian refugees in Philadelphia were talking seditiously behind Genêt’s back, and so Genêt ordered the ship to sail up to New York, where the refugee population was much thinner. ",
            "In mid-August, Genêt and Galbaud had a final confrontation aboard the ship. Genêt stood by his plan to separate Galbaud from the sailors and send him back to France. So that night, Galbaud and his wife snuck onto a longboat, rode to shore and made a run for it. They made it to an inn in Westchester County before two French military police officers dispatched by Genêt caught up with them. But the ex governor managed to slip out the back door and make for Canada. Meanwhile, Lady Galbaud stayed behind at the inn and entertained one of the military policemen for a week, while the officer wrote reports back to Genêt saying, “I’ve got Galbaud cornered. Don’t worry about it.” Make of all that what you will. As soon as Galbaud crossed over to Canada, he was arrested by the British and taken to Quebec City, where he was held until October, when he escaped and crossed back over to New York. Now basically a penniless vagabond, Galbaud found meager accommodations near the border in case he had to run forward again. ",
            "Meanwhile, Genêt was continuing to annoy the American government, but also handle the frequent requests of refugees to either go back to Saint Domingue or sail on to France. But Genêt was now purposefully deflecting their requests. He knew that both the British and Spanish had agents recruiting in the refugee communities, so anyone going back to the colony was sure to be going to join the enemies of the Republic. Meanwhile, anyone going back to France was sure to denounce Sonthonax and Polverel, and now likely Genêt himself, and cost them their jobs and possibly their heads. Little did Genêt know that the American ambassador in Paris had already denounced him, and his recall order was in the mail. ",
            "Into this angry, resentful and combative environment, the Tricolor Commission arrived in the United States in early November. On November 8, they landed in Philadelphia and when the French sailors and refugees found out who was on board, they were furious. Mills and Belley elected to remain on their ship and not risk walking the streets publicly. The white delegate, Louis Dufay, tried to go out, but as soon as he went ashore, he was identified and surrounded by an angry mob of Frenchmen, and it was only with the help of a local woman that he was guided safely away. But then a further mob just marched up the gang plank of the commissioner’s ship. They accosted Mills and Belley and ransacked their quarters. Only after some serious pushback was this mob dispersed. ",
            "So the captain of the ship then prudently sailed on up to New York, which, like I said, did not really have a significant refugee population to accost the commissioners. When they arrived on November 10, Genêt welcomed them with a public reception that acknowledged the Commission as an official government delegation. And this is when Belley gets to do one of his first, as he is the first black to be recognized as an official government representative of anything in the United States or in France. The Tricolor Commission remained in New York for the next month under Genêt’s auspices. But the refugee French and French sailors both continued to make ominous noises about attacking and possibly even assassinating a lot of them. So the six commissioners agreed to split up into two groups. And on December 10, Genêt put Dufay, Mills and Belley on one of the French government’s fast messenger boats and ordered the captain to sail them to France as fast as possible. There are rumors that the angry French refugees actually tried to hire some of the sailors to murder the commissioners en route, but to no avail. ",
            "So just to wrap up our loose ends here, not long after the Commission sailed, a penniless Governor Galbaud reemerged in New York City, looking for passage back to France. Genêt tried to get the American government to block this, but by now, Genêt himself was persona non grata with the American government. So Genêt said, “Fine, if you can pay for your passage, you can leave”, and eventually Galbaud will sail back to France. ",
            "Genêt also stopped trying to block the further passage of the other refugees. So by early 1794, they were either headed back to France, which, for the record, yes, seems like a pretty crazy time to be wanting to go back to France. But even crazier are the ones headed back to Saint Domingue. Now, some had decided to reconcile with the new order and reclaim their property, but as Genêt suspected, a bunch of the others joined the Spanish and British as auxiliary forces to go retake what was theirs by force. Other refugees chose to permanently settle in America, where they were soon joined by émigrés fleeing the reign of terror, like, for example, Moreau de Saint-Méry, the great colonial expert and one time big white delegate to the National Assembly. By now, he’s a counterrevolutionary swine, and in October 1793, he ducked out of France, one step ahead of an arrest warrant. After landing in Philadelphia, Saint-Méry would remain there for years. He opened up a bookshop that soon became a hub of the best bred and best educated of the French émigrés, including, eventually, Talleyrand. When Talleyrand arrived in Philadelphia, he spent practically every night hanging out in the rooms above Saint-Méry’s bookshop, chatting, playing cards and waiting for his chance to get the hell out of this backwater and back to the real action. ",
            "Back in the real action, the Tricolor Commission finally made it to Paris at the end of January 1794, and boy, did they walk into a crazy mess. We are now at Episode 3.36, “The Liquidation Process”, when the revolution is now truly devouring all her children. There was a paranoid factional struggle between the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security and the Ultras and the Indulgents, and then Robespierre’s little death cult in the middle. The Tricolor Commission is about to become a pawn in this deadly game. And to explain how and why, we need to back up a little bit. ",
            "So when last we left Paris, King Louis had just signed the Law of April 4. And then in July 1792, Sonthonax and Polverel and ‘the other guy’ had sailed away. The Law of April 4 was a major setback for the big white colonial interests, but it was nothing compared to what came next: the Insurrection of August 10. The Club Massiac was full of liberal nobles and enlightened bourgeoisie, like Moreau de Saint-Méry, who were now all suspected of counterrevolutionary leanings. The Club Massiac pretty much ceased functioning after August 10, but the colonial interests were not done yet. Just before the Second Commission arrived in Le Cap, the Colonial Assembly had selected a few delegates to go back to Paris to make sure that the Law of April 4 was not followed with anything crazy like the emancipation of all the slaves. When these guys arrived in Paris, they discovered, holy crap, the King has been overthrown and France is now a republic. Thinking fast, these colonial representatives denounced the Club Massiac types as being in league with the counterevolutionary aristocrats, and they pitched slavery as necessary for the survival of the Republic, because obviously we’re all patriotic Republicans now. But they still face two major hurdles. First, Brissot remained a major power in the new National Convention, especially on colonial matters. He and his ally, Julien Raimond, were not about to let their work be undone. And second, Paris, frankly, had bigger fish to fry. When the National Convention convened, the Mountain and Girondins descended into their blood feud. They put Louis on trial, and then when they chopped his head off, they had to deal with the mass eruption of war and rebellion. Colonial affairs were totally deprioritized. ",
            "But the white colonial interests did get a few boosts along the way. In January 1793, just as Louis was facing Madame La Guillotine, the first wave of men deported by the Second Commission arrived in Paris ready to denounce Sonthonax and Polverel. But the real boost came in June 1793, when the Girondins were purged from the Convention. Because the Second Commissioners were identifiably Brissot’s boys, the white colonial lobbyists were now able to paint their work as a counterrevolutionary Girondin plot to destroy the colony – a story the now purged Convention was ready to gobble up. So, as I said at the beginning of the show, on July 16, the Convention ordered the recall of Sonthonax and Polverel to return home and face the Revolutionary Tribunal. Then, at the end of August, word of the destruction of Le Cap and the mass exodus of the whites arrived and everyone in Paris now solidly believed that the Second Commission was to blame for everything, and further, that they were an actively sinister force that had to be stopped. But the official agents sent to convey the recall order and bring the commissioners home to stand trial got trapped in Brest thanks to British naval patrols, and spent the next few months just never setting sail. ",
            "As the reign of terror prepared to really get going in October 1793, Paris hit peak anti-Girondin fury. After Brissot’s arrest back in June, Julien Raimond had tried to keep a low profile. But on September the 27th, he too was denounced and arrested. When all his Girondin friends were executed a few weeks later, Raimond had to believe that he would soon be next. It also just so happens that mid-October 1793 is also when word of general emancipation hits and everyone becomes really super convinced that this is all a Girondin plot to help destroy the Republic. ",
            "But then, in December, everything suddenly flipped upside down when two pieces of news were revealed almost simultaneously. First, correspondence between the renegade big whites and the British government about handing the colony over were published. Suddenly, everyone knew that since at least February, the white colonial interests had been actively in league with the enemies of the Republic. And then the second bit of news was the incontrovertible proof of this treasonous alliance. News that Jérémie and Môle-Saint-Nicolas had opened their harbors to the British. Suddenly, the Second Commission and their emergency emancipation order looked like a truly patriotic response to white colonial treason. So the verdict that Sonthonax and Polverel were enemies of the Republic was suddenly being reconsidered. ",
            "But as I said, colonial policy is very much now being viewed through the lens of the really super dangerous world of Paris politics during the Reign of Terror. For complicated reasons, the white colonial lobbyists had wound up attached most especially to the Ultras in all of this, and particularly had allies in the Committee of General Security. So it was by order of the Committee of General Security that Julien Raimond had been arrested. And when the Tricolor Commission arrived in Paris at the end of January 1794, the Committee of General Security acted on a colonial lobby request and arrested them too. Oddly enough, though, only Dufay and Mills were tossed in jail, while Belley was left alone, no one quite knowing what to do with him. But the Committee of Public Safety soon ordered all these guys released because, because like I just said, 1) this was just a further skirmish in the power struggle between the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security. But then, 2) the official story was now changing. The white colonial lobbyists are the really real traitors in all of this. So let’s hear what this Tricolor Commission has to say. ",
            "On February 3, 1794, the Tricolor Commission were presented to the National Convention and were then accepted as official delegates from the North Province of Saint Domingue, making Jean-Baptiste Belley the first black legislator in French history, possibly even European history, unless I’m missing somebody. The next day, Louis Dufay delivered a stirring speech in defense of the Second Commission and more importantly, the Emancipation Decree. But critically, Dufay blew right past the moral reasons for ending slavery, because nobody cares much about that. He focused exclusively on the role the freed slaves, now free citizens, would play in defending the Republic in the Caribbean. He also told a pretty sweet lie about how the slaves had spontaneously rallied to the commissioners during the Battle of Le Cap and had cried, “Long lived the Republic” as they went into battle. The same black citizen soldiers were now the only thing protecting Saint Domingue from falling to the British. Dufay also stressed the restrictive nature of emancipation, that the commissioners had made sure to put rules in place to make sure the economy kept going, and he said, “You will see that your colony of Saint Domingue, cultivated by free hands, will be more flourishing, that this new colony will produce more for the Metropole than before.” ",
            "When Dufay was finished, the National Convention took a vote. And what a vote it turned out to be. On that day, 16 Pluviôse, Year II – February 4, 1794, to you and me, the National Convention ignored Dufay’s careful focus on the legal restrictions of emancipation and unanimously decreed, quote ",
            "“the National Convention declares that slavery of Negroes is abolished in all the colonies. In consequence, it decrees that all men, without distinction of color domiciled in the colonies, are French citizens and will enjoy all rights guaranteed by the Constitution. This degree is referred to the Committee of Public Safety, which will report immediately on measures for its implementation.” ",
            "This was a stunning blanket emancipation order of all the slaves, not just in Saint Domingue, but the entire French Empire. This was not freedom for service. This was not freedom with labor rules. This was not gradual. There was no compensation to former owners. This was just freedom. ",
            "In the euphoric aftermath of the vote, Belley took to the floor and said, “I was a slave during my childhood. 36 years have passed since I became free through my own labor and purchased myself. Since then, in the course of my life, I have felt worthy of being French.” He then went on to say that the Tricolor flag had become the beacon of liberty that he and his brothers would defend with their lives. Danton, in one of his last public speeches before getting beheaded, cried, “This is the death of the English!” All the slaves in Saint Domingue were now free citizens of France. ",
            "And before we head back to Saint Domingue, though, I will note a little coincidence that I did not realize until I was putting this week’s show together – that the very next day, February 5, 1794, is the day Robespierre came forward and delivered his famous speech on public morality, with its link between virtue and terror that we discussed in Episode 3.37, “The Republic of Virtue”. Oddly enough, the man who had once fought to ensure that the word ‘slavery’ was not included in the French constitution made no reference to the incredible abolition of slavery that had just been decreed the day before. ",
            "So now, heading back to Saint Domingue, the Second Commission would have a long time to wait before this epic vindication of all their work arrived. After the Tricolor Commission set sail, it was a harrowing seven months before they found out, and even then, the vindication was not without a major caveat for them personally. So after the Tricolor Commission sailed away, Sonthonax and Polverel were quickly dealt another major blow. The colored leaders in Saint-Marc, long one of their main bases of support, decided that the commissioners had gone too far and that emancipation was an intolerable betrayal. After making contact with British agents in November, the Saint-Marc coloreds voted to invite them into the harbor. The deal was straightforward: if you recognize racial equality and help us maintain slavery, we will help you take Saint Domingue away from the French. ",
            "But the coloreds were in for a rude awakening. The British agents likely would have promised 10,000 magical unicorns to get the British in the door. But official ministry policy, as agreed to back in February with the renegade white colonists, was that, quote, “coloreds will have the same rights as this class in English colonies”, which meant that whatever territory the British controlled, the coloreds were about to go back to being second class citizens. So, no unicorns. ",
            "With the coloreds betraying the Republic, Polverel rushed to Port-au-Prince to make sure the always seditious capital didn’t flip too. And I forgot to mention this, but in fine revolutionary fashion, after the Second Commissioners had retaken the city back in April, they had renamed it Port-Républicain. But since this was pretty short lived, I’m just going to keep calling it Port-au-Prince, if that’s cool with everybody. Now the situation became critical enough that then Sonthonax rushed down, too, leaving Colonel Lavaux in charge of the military situation in the north. Lavaux then moved his forces over to Port-de-Paix, which was west of Le Cap, where he planned to hold the line against any British encroachments. I’ve got a map of all this at www.revolutionspodcast.com. But luckily for Lavaux, Sonthonax and Polverel, the British were about to make no headway over the winter. They captured a few more ports and held some coastal territory, but were unable to push inland or link any of their captured territories together. ",
            "For one, like all Europeans, British soldiers were dropping like flies from tropical diseases. And then the mountainous interior of Saint Domingue is, as we’ve seen, pretty brutal territory and riddled with armed enemies, whether independent slave insurgents who had no interest in the British trying to reimpose slavery, or armed colored armies who had elected to stick with the Republic, because the emancipation order had split the colored community right down the middle. So some of the Second Commissioners’ allies defected to the British, but others, like André Rigaud in the south, denounced the perfidy of his brothers and stayed true to the Republic. ",
            "It was as a result of his conduct during these troubled months that Rigaud really cemented the foundation for his rule in the south. With the emancipation decree in hand, he was, for example, able to talk most of the leaders of the Kingdom of Platon into joining what Rigaud was now calling the Legion of Equality, a mixed colored and black army that would uphold racial equality and slave emancipation by force against all comers. Most of the leaders accepted the deal and were enrolled as captains in the Legion, and they brought with them about 1,200 men. And I can’t nail this down, but I’m also pretty sure this is the moment when the Kingdom of Platon gets redubbed the Republic of Platon, which is what it’s called in many history books on the subject. But Rigaud’s vision of emancipation was enforcing the rules of labor imposed by the Second Commissioners. And in the territory Rigaud controlled, those blacks not fighting were expected to return to their plantations and work, and he expected the black leaders to help keep them there. ",
            "But while the staunch support of Rigaud and his forces will be critical to the survival of the mission of the Second Commissioners, there was nothing quite like the almost miraculous news they received in May 1794: Toussaint Louverture was prepared to switch his allegiance from Spain to France. Now, it is likely that Toussaint had been considering this option even as he was denouncing Sonthonax’s emancipation decree back in August. With the Republican cause both in Europe and the Caribbean seemingly on the brink of collapse, the principal slave generals were already positioning themselves for the new order to come. Jean-François and Biassou’s partnership was now more tenuous than ever as each prepared to rush into the post-French vacuum and become the supreme leader of the colony. Meanwhile, Toussaint, who was technically Biassou second in command, had positioned himself in the greatest position of all. Jean-François controlled the eastern part of the North Province, Biassou controlled the southern part, both with easy access to the Spanish. Toussaint, meanwhile, had gotten himself put in charge of the west territory that bordered the cordon of the west. Over the winter of 1793-1794, Toussaint methodically took the forts of the cordon one by one and by October he had captured the port city of Gonaïves, and suddenly it was Toussaint who held the all important line between the West Province and the North Province. Operating now on his own and away from Spanish supervision, Toussaint likely began to think hard about what to do with this new position. He was never going to be able to outmaneuver Jean-François and Biassou by way of the Spanish. They had more direct and deeper ties to the Spanish authorities and Toussaint would always be a mere subordinate in the Spanish hierarchy. So if he wanted to be anything more than that, and by now it’s pretty clear that he wants to be a lot more than that, then the Spanish are not his best allies. Then, at the end of 1793 word started filtering up that all those Spanish boasts that the French Republic was on the brink of collapse was a lot of hot air. The Republic still stood and was possibly even winning the war back in Europe. So whose promises really counted for what around here? ",
            "And then there was also the subtle distinction between the emancipation offered now by the French, which was general, and the Spanish, which was limited to the soldiers – the standard freedom for service deal. The Spanish had made it clear that they had no intention of abolishing slavery as such and Toussaint may have by now made up his mind that general emancipation was the only way forward for Saint Domingue. So a calculated jump over to the French at this moment might be the perfect move. And it was! ",
            "In March 1794 Toussaint and Biassou exchanged a serious set of letters indicating that they were both getting pretty tired of each other. Then it is supposed that in April, news of the National Convention’s mass emancipation decree arrived and that pushed Toussaint over the edge. At the end of April, Toussaint’s black soldiers in Gonaïves suddenly turned on their Spanish comrades, killing them all and forcing the town’s people to flee. Toussaint said, “I had nothing to do with this. Let me go look into it and I’ll punish the perpetrators of this crime, blah, blah, blah.” When he arrived, he suddenly announced the existence of a secret offer from Colonel Lavaux to join the French Republican Army as a Brigadier General. Then Toussaint announced he was taking the deal. He brought with him 4,000 well trained soldiers, the cordon of the west, and all the parishes under his control, including Acul, Limbé and Dondon, parishes that had been at the very heart of the initial revolt. He also brought with him top flight black officers who would soon go on to play a major role in the history of Haiti, for example, Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henri Christophe. ",
            "Toussaint’s sudden defection to the French breathed new life into the Republican cause and not a moment too soon. In early June, the depleted British got some reinforcements and launched a renewed assault on Port-au-Prince. Sonthonax and Polverel could not hold them off and were forced to flee down to Jacmel. The British captured the capital on June 4. Four days after that, while in Jacmel, the agents of the National Convention finally, finally arrived with two pieces of news. The first so, so sweet, the other so, so bitter. The agent invited Sonthonax and Polverel onto his ship and said the Convention has not only ratified your emancipation decree, it has taken them even further. The slaves are all free. They are all now citizens. Emancipation had been the Second Commissioners’ most controversial act. The unanimous endorsement by the home government must have been a huge relief. But then the other news dropped. The Committee of Public Safety had upheld the recall order. Sonthonax and Polverel were to remain on board the ship for immediate deportation back to France to face the Revolutionary Tribunal. ",
            "The commissioners were not even allowed to return to shore. But they were able to hastily dispatch a few final arrangements. By order of the Convention, Lavaux was officially promoted to governor general, which is finally a really great choice. And Sonthonax wrote him a letter that said “Whatever happens, you have to hold the colony at all costs.” Polverel, meanwhile, wrote to Rigaud invested him with autonomous authority over the south. With the colony so divided and with the British everywhere, it was pointless for Lavaux and Rigaud to try to work together. So with this last order, Polverel said to Rigaud, “You are the absolute authority in the south.” And Rigaud would keep this authority until he was defeated by Toussaint in the final War of Knives in 1800. Because don’t worry, gang, the fun never stops in the Haitian revolution. ",
            "Next week, the new Republican Tricolor Triumvirate of Lavaux, Toussaint and Rigaud will launch simultaneous campaigns against both the British invaders and Toussaint’s old comrades, Jean-François and Biassou. With France now exploding outward back in Europe, thanks to the levée en masse and the Republican forces winning battles in the field in Saint Domingue, Toussaint had to be quite gratified to know that he had indeed switched sides at the perfect moment.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "When the Second Commission sailed away from Saint Domingue in June 1794, the fate of the colony was truly up in the air on almost every front. On the one hand, the British had invaded and now occupied a series of ports in the west and south provinces. The main slave armies of the north, meanwhile, had resisted all French republican overtures and reaffirmed their allegiance to the Spanish. And then the coloreds, who had once upon a time been the Republic’s staunchest allies, were now defecting to the enemy in droves. None of this was good news. But on the other hand, the National Convention had accepted the Tricolor Commission as official delegates from the colony, ratified the emancipation decrees in a sweeping declaration of liberty and equality, and perhaps most importantly, the French Republic still stood. Contrary to all expectations, the French Republic had not collapsed in 1793. And then the last bit of good news for the Second Commissioners as they sailed away is that they were leaving the defense of Saint Domingue in pretty capable hands. André Rigaud in the south, now Governor General Lavaux in the north, and then Toussaint Louverture holding the mountains in between. So the good news and bad news was a pretty even ratio in the summer of 1794. And the future of the colony was a blank canvas to be painted by whoever emerged victorious in the struggles yet to come. ",
            "Now, the lives of the inhabitants of Saint Domingue in the summer of 1794 offers a glimpse at what the possible future might be, depending on who emerged victorious from the struggles yet to come. The very worst outcome, I think it’s fair to say, would be if the British managed to complete the conquest of the colony. Depending on how you did the math, a good 60,000 to 80,000 people now lived in British occupied areas. And wherever the British went, they turned back the clock to 1788. The emancipation decrees of the Second Commission were obviously nullified, and black slaves will return to work as slaves. But that was not all. The British also ignored any promises made to the coloreds to maintain racial equality. Wherever the British were, whites were elevated to command positions, while coloreds were pushed aside, even colored leaders who had invited the British in in the first place. So that was one possible future for the colony: the British conquest, spelling the end of liberty and equality and the return of big white supremacy. ",
            "A second option was found in the territories in the South Province, now controlled by André Rigaud. Rigaud is obviously an uncompromising defender of racial equality. Duh. But as a staunch ally of the Second Commission and the French Republic, Rigaud was ready to accept the reality of slave emancipation. But as we touched on at the end of last week’s episode, that emancipation would come with restrictions. Liberty did not just mean everybody doing whatever they wanted, the National Convention’s decree notwithstanding. Now, with all the upheavals that had gone on since 1791, the plantations of the South Province had been amongst the least disrupted in the colony. Most of them still stood and still functioned. And Rigaud made sure that the former slaves kept working those plantations, though they were now cultivators who enjoyed some rights and a small cut of the profits, and there were actually profits to be made down here. One huge thing Rigaud had going for him was that he had kept Les Cayes out of British hands and the port continued to be more or less functional. It was, in fact, the only major port still fully functional in the French Republican orbit. So Rigaud’s people were able to cart their stuff down to Les Cayes and successfully export it, usually through merchants from the United States. But while black cultivators now got a small cut of the profits, they found themselves forced to do the same work the day after emancipation that they had been doing the day before emancipation. So on a day to day level, not much has really changed for them. ",
            "Now, the people who did enjoy a major change for the better under Rigaud’s regime were his colored brethren. In the same way that Rigaud was implementing a very particular kind of slave emancipation, he was also implementing a very particular brand of racial equality. Rigaud, understandably, had no love for the whites. Now, he had some white allies, of course, but as a class, Rigaud had no interest in protecting white interests whatsoever. When the white exodus got going in earnest in 1793, Rigaud’s territory became littered with abandoned plantations. The buildings and equipment were all intact, but the white owners and managers had just fled. Now, Polverel’s policy towards these types of abandoned properties had been for the government to step in and run them directly. But Rigaud had a better idea. He started leasing them to private individuals to run in exchange for a cut of the profits. And who were the private individuals who had the capital and the access to take advantage of this deal? Well, all of Rigaud’s colored friends and allies, of course. The whites were all gone and the blacks had no money. So the coloreds wound up running everything. So that was the second possible future for Saint Domingue. The whites gone, the blacks either workers or mere common soldiers, and the coloreds holding all the political, economic and military authority. ",
            "Now, the third major option was in the territory in the borderlands between the north and west provinces under Toussaint Louverture’s control. Unlike Rigaud’s system of colored supremacy, Toussaint envisioned a new Saint Domingue shared by whites, coloreds and blacks together. Now, at this moment, this is obviously the most Looney Tunes vision of them all. Whites, coloreds and blacks living together in peace, harmony and prosperity? I mean, good luck with that, Toussaint. But remember who Toussaint was on the eve of the revolution. He was a free black plantation manager who had spent his life intersecting with all three groups. And he was liked and respected by all of them. And he, in turn, often saw the best each group had to offer, rather than just the worst. And he really did think he could make tricolor harmony work. After he jumped over to the French, he started trying to make it work. But Toussaint was no starry eyed dreamer. His intellect was coldly rational. So coexistence between the three groups was premised as much on what you were not going to get as it was on what you were going to get. ",
            "So towards the now free blacks, Toussaint embraced a vision of limited slave emancipation, just like Rigaud. And he enforced labor rules and demanded obedience to authority. You are not slaves and you will never be slaves again. You are forever free citizens. But you must work. And not just anywhere. You must work the plantations. Because while Toussaint could envision a Saint Domingue inhabited by all three races, he could not and never would be able to envision a Saint Domingue that survived without its lucrative sugar and coffee exports. ",
            "Meanwhile, to the free coloreds, he guaranteed racial equality. I mean, white supremacy had gotten its head chopped off and posted on a spike as far as Toussaint Louverture was concerned. But he would promise the coloreds no more than equality. He was not going to elevate them over the whites. And he soon demonstrated this in no uncertain terms. ",
            "As I said last week, there were whites now ready to reconcile themselves to the new regime. Some had been laying low in Saint Domingue, others were now returning to the colony after having taken flight. But when they came back, they found Toussaint surprisingly welcoming and quite generous. He honored old land and property titles, unlike André Rigaud, and, channeling Julius Caesar a bit, was magnanimous and forgiving towards men that Toussaint had literally been fighting just a few months before. If the whites respected that their workers were now workers and not slaves, and if the whites accepted that a black ex-slave was the supreme authority in town, they could come back and not just come back, but enjoy the protection of his regime and maybe even thrive. Toussaint made a big deal about respecting their private property and he diligently punished thieves and vandals whenever they were caught. ",
            "Now, one thing that Toussaint had to deal with that Rigaud did not was that the plantations of the Northern Plains had almost all been leveled by fire. But Toussaint had an answer to that too and he helped organize the rebuilding of the physical infrastructure. Both white and colored owners could expect nothing but help and encouragement from Toussaint and pretty soon, crazy option number three was making some headway. Whites, colored and blacks lived and worked side by side under the auspices of a benevolent black ex-slave who just wanted them all to thrive. ",
            "Now, the fourth option for the future was a total wild card that we only have to talk about briefly because by the end of today’s episode, it will be moot. That is what happens if the Spanish backed slave armies led by Jean-François and Biassou push their way down and seize control of Saint Domingue. Now, it’s hard to know exactly what they would have done or what kind of political arrangement they would have made with the Spanish, who, as I mentioned, would have granted freedom to the black soldiers but kept slavery intact. I can’t imagine, however, that a Jean-François and Biassou-led future has any place for the whites or the coloreds. ",
            "But while I’m here though, I should answer a question that I’ve gotten a few times about the Spanish. Why were they just cool with not only letting this massive slave rebellion go on, but actively supporting it? Weren’t they worried about it spilling over to Santo Domingo? And the answer is probably a little, but mostly not really. Spanish Santo Domingo was neither populated as French Saint Domingue, nor did it have as many slaves, nor was the slave-to-free ratio so wildly out of whack. Santo Domingo was just not the same type of mass slave economy that their French neighbors were. So the Spanish weren’t super worried about the gospel of slave revolutions spreading because there were actually more free Spaniards in Santo Domingo than slaves. So keeping their slaves in line seemed pretty doable. ",
            "And then there was also a geographic reason. The interior of Hispaniola was not very densely populated. Most of the Spanish lived on the southeast coast. So a marauding French slave army would have a lot of ground to cover before they made it. And then of course, there’s the very fact of their support for the slave armies. From day one, the Spanish bought the loyalty of Jean-François and Biassou to make sure exactly that sort of invasion never happened. ",
            "Okay, so hopefully that answers that question. And the fourth possible future for Saint Domingue, the Spanish backed slave armies overrunning the colony is never going to happen. So we can move on. ",
            "Now, finally, there was a fifth major option that existed everywhere and outside the jurisdiction of any of the little regimes that I’ve just mentioned. And that fifth option is black liberty. No restrictions. Liberty enjoyed after being purchased with sweat and blood. Break up the hated plantations, parcel out the land and live and work as truly free men and women. Throughout Saint Domingue, but most especially in the west and south, there were independent, unaligned, insurgent black communities, basically like the old maroon communities, but more numerous and better armed. These groups inhabited their own camps and bases in the mountains and they would be damned if they were going to get sent back to the plantations. And then even those blacks who continued to live on the plantations and who were allegedly subject to all these new labor rules (I mean, it’s not like they didn’t resist), the sheer scope and constant revisions of the cultivator labor codes are pretty clear proof that a lot of freed slaves had no interest in actually following all these crazy rules. They shirked their official duties to expand and cultivate their own plots of land. And these plots of land would not only give them an independent food supply, but the produce of that land could still be sold for a profit in the massively disrupted colonial economy. So as it turned out, it was super hard to keep freed slaves doing the same work they had done when they were slaves. And so they represented a fifth option. No more plantations, no more masters, no more rules. Just free men and women working and living for themselves. ",
            "So those were the five major options on the table for Saint Domingue in the Summer of 1794. And just to recap, they are first, the British military returning the colony to the old big whites who would restore white supremacy and slavery. Second, Rigaud’s system of colored supremacy with emancipation and labor rules. Third, Toussaint’s system of whites, coloreds and blacks working together to rebuild a plantation economy that would benefit them all. Fourth, whatever Jean-François and Biassou’s ultimate plans were, which we don’t really know. And then fifth, a totally decentralized system of freedom and small scale land ownership. So let’s see what happens next. ",
            "What happened first is that the new military alliance that had been forged between now Governor General Lavaux and Toussaint Louverture went on the offensive. In July 1794, Toussaint launched an attack on Jean-François’s positions in the eastern part of the North Province and drove the Grand Admiral’s forces back in disarray. Jean-François himself was forced to take a hasty flight much to Toussaint’s evident delight. Meanwhile, Governor Lavaux attacked bases that had been established by the Spanish and then garrisoned by actual Spanish soldiers rather than just their slave auxiliaries on the border between Saint Domingue and Santo Domingo. The surprise rejuvenation of the French Republicans in the north caught the Spanish line by surprise and brought ominous tidings of things to come. ",
            "Now, in apparent retaliation for this sudden attack and possibly showing what a Jean-François-led Saint Domingue might have looked like, Jean-François proceeded to commit one of the most infamous crimes in the course of the revolution. The fortress town of Fort Dauphin, located on the north coast of the colony near the Spanish border, had been captured by the slave armies and was now being garrisoned by a mixed force of Jean-François black soldiers, Spanish soldiers, and then 700 white French auxiliaries, some of them now ex-refugees from the Le Cap exodus. For reasons that are far from clear, just after the attack by Toussaint, Jean-François ordered his soldiers to surround and massacre the 700 French auxiliaries and the Spanish soldiers just looked on. Now, I’m not even sure what the point of it was, but he did it. And it sure did not help Spanish efforts to recruit more white Frenchmen to their side. ",
            "While Lavaux and Toussaint launched these military attacks, they also sent out political feelers trying to undermine the Spanish and British by breaking their local alliances. Toussaint had enough legitimacy with these slave insurgents that he could appeal to the black soldiers and officers and say, “Look, the French have granted full emancipation and they are going to win the war. The Spanish are the past and when the chips are down, your generals will sell you out. So defect now and we’ll welcome you with open arms.” Now, for the moment, this argument did not carry a ton of weight because the French Republic still seemed precariously perched atop a towering inferno. So Toussaint and Lavaux then turned to the coloreds who had defected to the British. They smuggled in messages to the leaders in Saint-Marc, for example, and asked “How are those British promises of racial equality treating you? Well, look, we understand that you’ve made a mistake so come back over to the Republic and we’ll all join forces and kick the British out together. And, oh, by the way, if you don’t come over voluntarily, Toussaint’s army is going to attack Saint-Marc, sack it and probably execute a whole lot of you for treason.” ",
            "But still, most of the colored leaders in Saint-Marc hesitated. And so Toussaint started marching south from his base in Gonaïves in August to make good on the threat. But lacking the forces necessary to just take the city in a direct assault, Toussaint employed a clever gambit. He sent down two of his most trusted officers to tell the British that Toussaint’s recent defection to the French was a ruse to solidify his position. And now that his position had been solidified, he was ready to really defect, this time to the British. Now, the British were receptive to this and it’s not like it wasn’t a believable story. Toussaint had been one of the leading anti French voices for the last three years. Discovering that his defection to the French was a ruse actually explained a somewhat inexplicable event. ",
            "But the real ruse was the story about the ruse. When Toussaint’s officers got into Saint-Marc, they made contacts with disaffected coloreds and there were quite a few of them, and planned an internal uprising to go with the external attack from Toussaint’s approaching army. All of this went according to plan and in mid-August, Toussaint attacked and then a bunch of armed coloreds suddenly rose up in Saint-Marc at the same time. But there were not enough of them. Many of the coloreds and the leaders still clung to the British promise that slavery would be maintained and equality maybe eventually implemented. With the internal uprising sputtering, Toussaint’s external attack ultimately failed, repelled by superior British firepower working from a strong defensive position. ",
            "Now, into the fall and winter of 1794, though, open war between all sides in this very complicated little conflict proceeded. In the north, Governor Lavaux kept the British contained on their base in Môle-Saint-Nicolas, while Toussaint returned to fighting Jean-François and Biassou and he made further thrust into the interior. In October, he went on a quick campaign, capturing various towns and looting and killing wherever he went. But he did not have sufficient forces to keep what he had conquered. So we always wound up falling back to his main bases along the cordon of the west. But still, Toussaint was clearly showing in the campaigns of 1794 that while he had very little practical military experience, he was turning out to be one of the best generals of the war. And he showed a true professional’s obsession with logistics and supplies and training. And he constantly begged Lavaux for more guns and more bullets, more shoes and more medicine. And he forced captured British or Spanish officers to train his men in proper technique and discipline. In December, he launched a very well executed multicolumn offensive that captured and this time held an important river that lay south of Le Cap. The columns were led by the two men fast becoming Toussaint’s most trusted lieutenants, Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Toussaint’s adopted nephew, Moyse. ",
            "Down in the south, meanwhile, André Rigaud’s Legion of Equality was morphing into what has historically become known as the Legion of the South. And he battled to keep the British pinned down in the ports that they had captured and not let them move out. As Toussaint was rampaging up in the north in October, Rigaud managed to capture Léogâne and hold it, which prevented the British from creating a land link between their forces in Jérémie and Port-au-Prince. Not that the British in Port-au-Prince were going anywhere. They were currently besieged by one of those independent black armies that were not formally aligned with any of the principal leaders. They were just doing their own thing, but they had zero interest in the British winning and bringing back the big whites and slavery. So this army of 3,000 or 4,000 blacks surrounded and besieged Port-au-Prince, trapping the British in the capital where they slowly but surely succumbed one by one to tropical diseases. ",
            "Now, the attrition rate for the British was indeed quite alarming and threatened their whole project. So much so, that like everyone else in Saint Domingue, they too were forced to turn to slave auxiliaries to fight for them. Though the British very clearly meant to reimpose slavery, they too started offering individuals freedom in exchange for military service. And in the south, they found a very effective ally in a black leader named Jean Kina and the army of about 1,500 that he led. Kina and his men had originally been armed by whites in the south during that white-colored civil war that broke out in 1792. So they were among those who were not going to have their promises of freedom honored after the Law of April 4 spelled victory for the coloreds. Kina tried to join Rigaud’s Legion of Equality, but the colored officers, most of whom had just fought against Kina, wanted no part of him. So when the British came knocking, Kina and his men signed up and would fight for the British for the whole rest of the war. ",
            "So as the French and Spanish and British battle for control of Saint Domingue, among and between themselves, just remember that the battles themselves were usually black on black affairs. ",
            "Now, through the whole first half of 1795, a general stalemate endured that no one was able to decisively break through one way or the other. After a miserable winter cooped up in Port-au-Prince, the British managed to push their way up to Mirebalais, but then Toussaint swung down and pushed them back. But this action around Mirebalais cast first light on the future rivalry between Toussaint and Rigaud, especially in their competition for the loyalty and service of the blacks. Now, even though, as I just said, everyone had blacks fighting for them, that did not mean there weren’t serious tensions inside each army, and none more so than in Rigaud’s emerging Legion of the South. Black leaders were allowed to serve as junior officers, but all the senior commands went to coloreds. And then going all the way back to the betrayal of the Swiss, the blacks were always pretty suspicious of the ultimate intentions of the coloreds. And with so many coloreds having just hopped over to the British when emancipation hit, well, that was just further proof that it is entirely likely the coloreds are just going to use us and then put us all back in chains. ",
            "Black mistrust of the coloreds was then heightened still further back in February 1794, back when the Second Commission was still around. Sonthonax and Polverel had been working to forge a more formal anti-British alliance with some of these various independent black forces out there. And there was no black leader more respected than Hyacinthe. You remember that guy, that young religious leader who had helped the coloreds defeat the small whites at Croix-des-Bouquets in 1792? Well, he’s still a hugely influential voice in the slave communities of the west. But at some point over the winter of 1793-1794, Hyacinthe had been suddenly arrested by colored allies of the Second Commission on suspicion that he was the one who was actually in league with the British. Sonthonax had personally then come down, overturned the charges and set Hyacinthe free. But then in February 1794, Hyacinthe was lured to an isolated spot by some colored agents and just straight up assassinated. This murder came two weeks after another prominent black leader had been assassinated by armed coloreds in the south. So there was major tension between the blacks and coloreds. And with the sudden rise of Toussaint Louverture, a black leader who had been one of the original (well, almost one of the original) leaders of the initial slave uprising, many of the black fighters looked to Toussaint as their natural leader. Now fighting near the border with Rigaud’s territory, Toussaint was happy to cultivate their allegiance and bring them over to his side. What’s Rigaud ever done for you anyway? And so began a tug of war between Toussaint and Rigaud for the rank and file black soldiers of Saint Domingue. ",
            "So the stalemate that had set in by the summer of 1795 was, of course, broken by, you guessed it, events back in Europe. As has been the case since day one, the course of the French Revolution defined the course of the Haitian Revolution. So back to France we go, and where are we? Well, when last we were in Paris, it was February 1794 and the National Convention had just decreed mass emancipation and racial equality. But then the Committee of Public Safety had upheld the recall order of the Second Commission. And then, of course, we ended last week’s episode with Sonthonax and Polverel getting picked up and taken back to France in June 1794. While just as they were landing back in France, Paris was being convulsed by the end of the French Revolution, at least in my own idiosyncratic system of dating. On July 27, 1794, the enemies of Robespierre got together, chopped off his head and the Thermidorian reaction set in. And this is all happening just as Sonthonax and Polverel are returning to France. And it’s kind of crazy. They departed France just two weeks before the Insurrection of August 10 and then they returned just in time for Thermidor. It’s pretty lucky timing. ",
            "Now, what Thermidor meant for the various players in the battles over Saint Domingue was anyone’s guess. When Sonthonax and Polverel got back to Paris, they discovered that most of those various players were sitting in a jail cell. For example, they learned that their arch rival, Galbaud, did not share their lucky timing. Galbaud had finally made it back to Paris in April and had been promptly arrested and thrown in prison. Meanwhile, the principal lobbyists for the colonial whites have themselves been arrested, almost certainly due to their suspicious connections to the Committee of General Security. Also still in prison was Julien Raimond, having survived the initial liquidation of the Girondins, he too just languished in a cell. But luckily for all these guys, those were busy days for the Revolutionary Tribunal, and colonial matters did not rate as a very high priority. So all of them were still just sitting around in jail when Thermidor arrived. Now, when Sonthonax and Polverel showed up, they themselves were not thrown into prison proper, but they were placed under an implied house arrest. You know, just don’t go anywhere. ",
            "Once Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety had been overthrown, the various colonial interests, though not their lobbyists who were still in prison, poked their heads out, and were like, hey, so this is going to be the conservative reaction phase of the Revolution, right? Right! So let’s kick things off by repealing the most insanely revolutionary thing the Revolution ever did: the emancipation of the slaves. But the Thermidorian Convention, no less than the overthrown Committee of Public Safety, had way more important things to worry about than whatever was going on back in Saint Domingue. So for months after Thermidor, everyone with a genuine interest in the colony just had to sit around and wait. Raimond stayed in prison. The principal colonial lobbyist stayed in prison. Galbaud stayed in prison. Sonthonax and Polverel just waited around patiently to be put on trial. ",
            "It wasn’t until November 1794 that the Thermidorian Convention finally got around to the question of Saint Domingue and the actions of the Second Commission. The white lobbyists, Raimond and Galbaud, were all released on parole, and a committee was set up to investigate and render a verdict on the conduct of the Second Commission. Now, fortunately for Sonthonax and Polverel, this was not the Revolutionary Tribunal with its swift and summary justice, but unfortunately, it was kind of the other thing. A long bureaucratic slog through all the evidence and witness testimony. But in a curious decision that I have not ever seen adequately explained, it’s just this fact that is hanging out there, Galbaud was never allowed to testify at the trial. He wanted to. They just wouldn’t let him. I have no idea why. So the trial dragged on for months and months, and the nonstop stress of, like, everything that had happened to him since arriving in Saint Domingue in September 1792 was finally too much for Etienne Polverel. He died in April 1795, at the age of 55. ",
            "When the story of the Haitian revolution is told, pride of place is always given to Sonthonax, because he’s the one who issued the decree of August 29. But hopefully, I’ve shown that Polverel was right there in the middle of it with him. Both had started as totally obscure revolutionary backbenchers who went on to be the principal actors in the emancipation of all the French slaves. And sadly, he did not live long enough to see his work fully vindicated. ",
            "As the trial dragged on, though, the ultimate verdict was becoming clear, much to the delight of Sonthonax and the dismay of the colonial lobby. Because in one of the more surprising decisions made by the Thermidorians, as they prepared the Constitution of Year III that established the Directory, they decided that racial equality and slave emancipation would be upheld in the Republic of France. Now, partly this was a recognition of what’s done is done, but it was also a part of a shift in attitude towards the colonies. ",
            "Remember, in the early days of the Revolution, enlightened opinion was that this was all leading towards greater independence and home rule for the colonies. Well as the new concept of an indivisible French nation began to take hold, especially during the war, leading revolutionaries began to advocate a reverse conception: that wherever the tricolor flag flew was a part of the French nation – one and indivisible. So the  Constitution of Year III reflected this. It said there would no longer be a distinction between the Metropole and the colonies. All were equal to each other. Saint Domingue and Martinique and Guadeloupe and the rest were basically now just departments of greater France, and all French laws would be uniformly enforced everywhere. And since there were no slaves and no racial inequality in France, there could be none in the colonies. So, yes, as the conservative Directory settled into power, it explicitly upheld one of the most revolutionary things the radical revolutionaries had ever done. Then, just as the Convention was wrapping up loose ends in September 1795, the trial of the Second Commission wrapped up. Sonthonax and the late Polverel were cleared of all charges. They had done a good job and they had the thanks of the Republic. ",
            "Now, as we will see next week, Sonthonax and also Julien Raimond are not done in Saint Domingue, since they’re about to be two of the key members of the Third Commission. So we’ll leave them aside for now. But I do want to wrap things up with the depressing conclusion to the life and career of Governor Galbaud. ",
            "After being arrested in April 1794, Galbaud had spent eight months in prison. But when he was finally released, he discovered that his arrest record now precluded him from returning to the military, the only job he had ever known. In mid 1795, he managed to land a minor bureaucratic position in the Thermidorian government. He was then officially amnestied in the general political amnesty that was issued when the Directory took over. But his application to rejoin the army was still rejected, and it continued to be rejected for the duration of the Directory. And Galbeau was not allowed back into the army until after Bonaparte’s Coup of 18 Fructidor. But when he was finally let back in, he got what I think might have been the most rotten assignment in the history of the universe: he was posted to Egypt. That’s right. Two years after Bonaparte abandoned the expedition as a hopeless lost cause, and with the French forces in Egypt little more than a sad, forgotten, demoralized and plague ridden garrison that was about to surrender to the British, Galbaud received orders to take up a post in Cairo. So he and his wife packed their bags once again and headed off to the worst assignment imaginable. Long story short, he died of plague in 1801 at the age of 58. ",
            "So everything I just told you about what happened back in France is going to have a major impact on events in Saint Domingue. The arrival of the Directory represented the rational and sober ratification of a slave emancipation decree that had initially been issued in an emergency and then confirmed in the emotional heat of one of the most pressure cooker phases of the French Revolution. ",
            "But what really unclogged the military stalemate back in Saint Domingue and paved the way for the steady rise of Toussaint Louverture was the triumph of the French Republic on all fronts in the war against the Allies. Remember, mid 1795 is when the Dutch joined the French as the Batavian Republic, when the Prussians pull out of the war completely, but most importantly for our purposes, this is when the Spanish pull out of the war. Admitting defeat to the French Republic was a bitter pill for the Spanish to swallow, but they were really no match for the might of the fully mobilized French nation. And so they signed a peace treaty of their own in July 1795. This treaty not only stipulated an immediate end of hostilities on all fronts, including all colonial fronts, but get this, the handover of Santo Domingo to the French. The Spanish agreed to hand the entire island of Hispaniola over to the French. And it was that, more than anything else, that completely rearranged the military and political situation in Saint Domingue. ",
            "So next week, we will return to Saint Domingue to watch this bombshell news get dropped on everyone’s head. The Spanish are out of the war. What did that mean for Jean-François and Biassou? For the last four years, since the original slave uprising in August 1791, they had been the two principal slave generals. They had full claim to the prestige of being leaders in the initial fight for freedom. I mean, what’s going to happen if, for example, they suddenly decamped the island now that their Spanish benefactors are saying “We’re done funding, arming and supplying your armies.” Who would that leave as the only black leader who truly had the respect of all the black soldiers? I’ll tell you: Toussaint Louverture.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "In November 1795, news finally reached Saint Domingue of the incredible turn of events back in Europe that we ended with last week. Spain is out of the war. In the all important North Province of Saint Domingue, this news would change everything. Since August 1791, the slave armies of Jean-François and Biassou had occupied most of the province. And they had been able to maintain that occupation because of Spanish support. First, the clandestine support that had seen them transition successfully from passionate insurgents to a stable and pretty well organized army, and then, the official support that saw the Spanish bring that army under their banner. Now, Governor General Lavaux had run some successful campaigns against these forces back when he was still Colonel Lavaux. And as we saw last week, Toussaint Louverture was making inroads of his own. But in the main, Jean-François and Biassou had never been seriously threatened. But it was all premised on Spanish support, and that support was now gone. ",
            "So whatever fancy plans Jean-François and Biassou had dreamed up over the years, whatever that fourth option we talked about last week might have been, it would remain an eternal might have been. When the Spanish said, we’re cutting you off, British agents made contact and offered to replace the Spanish as patrons. But there were a number of problems with this. Logistically, British supplies could never be counted on the way that Spanish supplies could always be counted on, since they were just coming right over the border. But more importantly, the deal offered by the British was not nearly as appealing to Jean-François and Biassou as the old deal offered by the Spanish. The Spanish had essentially left the slave generals to their own devices with little or no direct oversight. Biassou was currently living like a de facto king down in this homemade palace of his. The British, on the other hand, plan to insert the slave generals into their regular command structure. They would have to take orders from British officers, do whatever the British said. So Jean-François and Biassou declined to hop over to the British. ",
            "Instead, the two slave generals decided it was time to get out while the getting was good. The Spanish offered them asylum as free men, and they said okay. Each general took with him a cadre of senior officers, and they decamped the island, forever. Jean-François and Biassou are never coming back. Biassou wound up resettling in Spanish Florida, where he was eventually given command of the black militia there, and there he died in 1801. Jean-François and his loyalists, meanwhile, went first to Havana, but the Spanish governor flipped out when the slave general and his entourage showed up, and he begged his superiors to deport them all before they started a slave revolt in Cuba. The Spanish authorities granted this request, and Jean-François’s group was taken back across the Atlantic to Cadiz. And their exile was not a comfortable one. Though the Spanish kept their word and allowed the black officers to live free, they did not grant them any sort of pension or recognize the ranks they had held during their two and a half years of service in the Spanish army. Jean-François himself would die in Cadiz, nearly penniless in 1805. So the grand admiral, and the governor general and royal viceroy are now totally out of the picture. ",
            "With their senior commanders gone, it was finally time for the insurgent army of the north to demobilize. And what to do with them all was a vexing question. These armies had obviously managed to hold out long enough that when their generals ditched out on them, the regular soldiers were not thrown back into chains. They were walking down into a world where they were officially free citizens. And amnesty and reconciliation did seem to be the order of the day. Toussaint, for example, was happy to recruit as many of these guys as he could directly into his own forces. But those who were tired of fighting were welcome to return to work on the plantations as free citizens, though they would, of course, be subject to all the labor laws that were now going into effect. All of this proceeded with no final spasm of death or destruction. And it is pretty remarkable that the final chapter of these original slave armies of the Northern Plains is a story told with practically no bloodshed at all. ",
            "Now, as we have seen many times on the Revolutions podcast, the removal of a shared enemy often leads to a factional conflict on the winning side. So with the threat of Jean-François and Biassou’s army removed, tensions within the French Republican ranks quickly erupted into open armed hostility. The tensions in particular were between two men who stood one rung below Governor General Lavaux in the command structure. Toussaint Louverture is obviously one of these two, and the other is a guy we haven’t talked about yet, and his name is Jean-Louis Villatte. Now, we don’t know a ton about Villatte, but he was a free colored, born in Saint Domingue in 1751. He appears to have joined a regiment of dragoons as a teenager in 1768, and was then among those who volunteered to join the expedition to the United States in 1778, where he fought at the Siege of Savannah. After that, we lose track of him, but I feel pretty confident saying that he was not in on Vincent Ogé’s uprising because most of the guys who escaped that little debacle wound up fighting with the slaves after August 1791. The next time we see Villatte pop up is when the Second Commission arrives and the battles over the Law of April 4 begin. When these battles led Sonthonax to create those free colored militias who were answerable only to the Second Commission, Villatte wound up a colonel in that militia. Villatte was then one of the principal officers, along with Jean-Baptiste Belley, fighting for the Second Commission during the Battle of Le Cap. And then when the British invaded and Lavaux moved his headquarters over to Port-de-Paix to contain them, he left Villatte in charge of the defense of Le Cap. ",
            "So, until Toussaint came over to the French side in April 1794, Villatte was the principal Creole officer in the North Province, and he was among the very few on the Republican side not absolutely thrilled when Toussaint defected, because right away Lavaux started to show preferential treatment for Toussaint. And of course, he was a little miffed that Toussaint had been offered a generalship after fighting against the Republic for the last three years. In July 1795, the National Convention approved all the field promotions Lavaux had doled out to his principal Creole officers, and the Convention officially made brigadier generals of, in the north Toussaint and Villatte, and then in the south André Rigaud and another guy that I have not talked about yet, and that’s Louis-Jacques Bauvais. ",
            "Bauvais was another of these prototypical free colored men who had struggled for dignity in the old apartheid system. Bauvais had been educated in Bordeaux and then, along with Villatte, taken part in the Savannah expedition and then returned to Saint Domingue to be a schoolteacher. When the revolution broke out, he was one of the first to take up arms to defend the Law of April 4. And then he had stuck with the Republic after emancipation and was now Rigaud’s chief lieutenant in the south. And Bauvais, too, is now a full brigadier general. ",
            "So of the four newly created Creole generals, it was three coloreds, all born free. And then Toussaint, the lone black, born a slave. And Villatte was super annoyed that Toussaint was now his equal, not only because he was a black ex-slave, but because Toussaint had spent the last three years fighting against the Republic that Villatte had put his own life on the line time and time again to defend. Villatte did not trust Toussaint even a little bit. But as long as Jean-François and Biassou were still out there, that conflict would simmer but never boil over. ",
            "Now that Jean-François and Biassou are departing, it’s time for Villatte to boil over. But his anger and frustration with Lavaux is really what got him going, especially after Lavaux moved his headquarters back to Le Cap after having spent the better part of a year in Port-de-Paix. Now, probably some of Villatte’s anger comes from being the boss, because the boss is out of the office. And now that the boss is back in the office, it being kind of annoying that you’re not the boss anymore. But there was more to it than that. The first thing Lavaux did upon his return was release a whole bunch of black prisoners that Villatte had been keeping locked up, which possibly implied a continuation of Lavaux’s growing preference for the blacks over the coloreds. After this initial slap in the face, Lavaux then proceeded to really offend Villatte and his allies. Over the past year, the coloreds in Le Cap, under Villatte’s protection, had been busy rebuilding the city. As I mentioned in passing, Le Cap had been built mostly out of brick and stone. So though everything flammable had burned in June 1793, the core structures all remained and the colored citizens spied a golden opportunity. They laid claim to all the abandoned white property and built it back up. But when Lavaux arrived back in the city, the governor and his treasury secretary were like, “Wow, guys, this looks great. But just so you know, according to Republican law, property abandoned by émigrés automatically reverts to the state. So you can keep occupying the property, but we do expect a small rent.” This came as an abrupt and pretty obnoxious shock. ",
            "But the thing that was really grating is that Governor General Lavaux just wasn’t one of them. And it wasn’t that he wasn’t colored, but that he wasn’t Creole. He was a Frenchman. France was his home, not Saint Domingue. So why should he order us around in our own home? And this gets to the heart of the newly forming conflict that we’re about to see, because back in 1791, it was the whites who wanted self government and the coloreds allied with the Metropole. Well, now that the whites are gone. It’s the coloreds who are now chafing under French authority and the coloreds who will start agitating for self government. ",
            "Villatte did not make his move right away, though, in fact, much to Toussaint’s great annoyance, Villatte was doing a bit of careful planning. He sent agents out into the camps under Toussaint’s command, asking if Toussaint’s men were happy with their situation. They said “Life in Le Cap has been great for us. Villatte pays us more and we are treated way better.” ",
            "According to letters sent from Toussaint to Governor Lavaux, we know that at least some of Toussaint’s men began to transfer their allegiance over to Villatte. ",
            "Finally, on March 20, 1796, Villatte made his surprise move. He gathered a company of armed men, pushed into Lavaux’s headquarters and arrested the Governor General. Then he said that because Lavaux had lost the support of the people, that Villatte was declaring himself Governor General. So March 20, 1796 straight up armed coup by General Louis Villatte. To help solidify his position inside the city, Villatte then spread the rumor that the principal impetus for the coup was news that ships had arrived in the harbor and that they were literally carrying chains. That now that the Spanish were gone, Lavaux had new orders from Paris to re-enslave all the blacks. ",
            "Now, one thing we do not know is how much of a role colored leaders down in the west or south provinces, and André Rigaud – we are looking at you, had to do with any of this. But we do know that there was no simultaneous rising on their part or ready declaration of allegiance to Villatte. So it’s entirely possible that he was just out there acting on his own. But it was also over so quickly that it’s tough to tell if it was supposed to be a part of a broader colored insurrection. ",
            "So men loyal to Governor Lavaux managed to get word of the coup spread to nearby army camps, camps that were run by men not allied with Villatte, particularly the one led by Pierrot. You remember him? He was the first slave leader to come over to the Republic. He had been fighting alongside Lavaux for years now and raised his men to prepare defense of the Governor General. But Pierrot was just one stop on the messenger chain. The final destination was Toussaint. Toussaint was in Gonaïves on March 20, but when he found out that Lavaux had been arrested, he immediately raised his army and sent word back to Le Cap saying I have raised my army. ",
            "Meanwhile, Villatte appears to have recognized that whatever careful planning had gone into the coup was not enough. Because just as he had spread the rumor that the French wanted to put the blacks back into chains, allies of Lavaux spread the rumor, a rumor they might have actually believed, that Villatte’s coup was just the first stage of a plan to hand the city over to the British. It’s not like colored leaders haven’t done it before. So it’s really Villatte who stands for re-enslavement. So Villatte was unable to muster unified support for his coup inside Le Cap, and he realized that if Toussaint really did come marching down out of the mountains, that there would be no opposing him. So on March 22, Villatte let Lavaux go. And as Toussaint’s army did indeed start approaching, 10,000 strong by some estimates, Villatte and his principal conspirators fled the city. ",
            "Villatte’s failed coup was so incredibly beneficial to Toussaint Louverture that it’s practically like Villatte was in on some convoluted plan to bring Toussaint to power. Because Toussaint’s army, being the reason the coup failed, meant that Toussaint was now the savior of both Governor General Lavaux and the Republic. If there was any doubt that the one man in Saint Domingue Lavaux could really count on was Toussaint, those doubts were all gone. As a reward for his service, Lavaux promoted Toussaint to Deputy Governor, second in command of all the French military and subordinate only to Lavaux. Technically, this elevated Toussaint even above André Rigaud. So in less than a year, Toussaint had gone from the third ranking general of a Spanish backed slave army to second in command of the French colony of Saint Domingue. And that Spanish backed slave army he had abandoned no longer existed. Toussaint has very good timing. ",
            "So Toussaint was now in a prime position to do what it’s pretty clear he was now aiming to do: become the master of Saint Domingue. He enjoyed the loyalty and support of men across the board. The whites in the north certainly found him to be a man they could do business with. And though Villatte had attempted to paint Toussaint as anti-colored, it’s clear from his actions over the past year that Toussaint wasn’t anti-colored at all. He just wasn’t exclusively pro-colored any more than he was pro-white or pro-black. So there were a lot of coloreds who also found Toussaint to be a man they could do business with. And then you’ve got Lavaux writing letters back to Paris now saying, this is the guy that you can count on more than any other. So the government back in France supports him. And then, of course, with Jean-François and Biassou now out of the picture, there was no one who could challenge Toussaint’s claim to be the natural leader of the black majority of the population. So in April 1796, there wasn’t anybody in Saint Domingue with more authority nor commanding more loyalty than Toussaint Louverture. ",
            "Except at that very moment, a man was stepping onto a ship back in France who could very much challenge all that authority and loyalty, especially within the all important black community, because Léger-Félicité Sonthonax is coming back to Saint Domingue. ",
            "So as we discussed last week, when it came to colonial matters, the Directory had come to power with two key principles. First, liberty and equality would be upheld – no more slavery, no more racism. Second was the theory that the colonies were now simply a part of the French nation – one and indivisible. The colonies did not require, nor did they deserve, special laws, special treatment or special restrictions. And to ensure that this new theory of liberty, equality and unity were upheld, in January 1796, the Directory created a five man commission to transmit this all to Saint Domingue and make sure it was obeyed. This is the Third Commission. And yes, I know the Haitian Revolution loves a good commission almost as much as the French Revolution loved a good coup. ",
            "So, just to remind you, the First Commission was sent by the National Assembly in 1791 to confirm the right of colonial self rule on internal matters. The Second Commission had then been sent by the Legislative Assembly in 1792 to enforce racial equality, but also defeat the slave uprising without freeing all the slaves. The Third Commission is now being sent by the Directory in 1796 to guarantee both racial equality and emancipation, and then also officially fold the colony into the French nation, one and indivisible. ",
            "The most prominent of the new commissioners was, of course, Sonthonax. After being fully vindicated for his work on the Second Commission, he was now being put on the Third Commission to continue his job. Next, was the man that Brissot had so badly wanted to put onto the second commission, Julien Raimond. Raimond, too, had been fully cleared of any lingering political charges in the wake of Thermidor and was now returning to Saint Domingue for the first time in 12 years. Raimond had started his career in France, lobbying the Royal Ministry to undo its apartheid system. Then he had lobbied the National Assembly for colored equality, then the Legislative Assembly, and then the National Convention, and then he had gotten thrown in jail, and now he was lobbying the Directory. And through it all, he maintained a laser focus on racial equality and never really paid more than lip service to the idea of maybe general emancipation of the slaves at some point down the road. But with emancipation now settled, Raimond accepted it and was ready to move forward. The third guy I’ll mention is Philippe Roume, who had been one of the First Commissioners and who will be returning to the colony for the first time in four years. No doubt hoping and praying that when he stepped off the boat in Le Cap this time there wasn’t some new revolt to deal with. The Commission was rounded out by two other guys who do nothing of any importance. So I won’t trouble you trying to remember their names. ",
            "The Third Commission got on a ship in April 1796, and when their convoys sailed, they brought along with them some military reinforcements led by General Rochambeau, who we last saw taking up a post in Martinique. And when we last saw Rochambeau, I mentioned that he would return to Saint Domingue with the Leclerc expedition, which he does, but I totally forgot that he also makes this little interim return to Saint Domingue with the Third Commission. So Rochambeau brought with him 1,200 men, which doesn’t seem like much if the French are really serious about pushing the British out of the colony. But they also brought with them 20,000 muskets. It had become clear to everyone that sending more European reinforcements was a waste of resources and also, I suppose, lives. And that one of the biggest practical benefits to emancipation was that all those new black citizens would become patriotic soldiers of the Republic. So the Third Commission escorted the armaments necessary to create a black army. A black army full of soldiers who knew the terrain and who would not just drop dead and who would then go beat the crap out of the British. This is what Danton meant when he shouted, “This is the death of the English!” after the National Convention approved general emancipation. ",
            "The Third Commission arrived in Le Cap on May 11, 1796, and discovered that since they had departed, there had indeed been a revolt, but not a mass black uprising. Rather, Villatte’s aborted coup. So the aftermath of that coup defined the new political environment they stepped into. And that new environment is a weird through the looking glass version of the political environment we’ve seen thus far. Because, as I just mentioned, ever since the French Revolution had hit, the whites had been the ones agitating for self government, while the coloreds had been the staunchest supporters of the Metropole and then the Republic. Well, now, that’s been flipped. The whites who remained in Saint Domingue were way off of home rule and welcomed full integration with France. It is now the coloreds who are agitating for self government and possibly even independence. So why the switch? Well, that’s easy. The whites are now way less powerful than the coloreds. And where the coloreds had once looked to France as their protector, they now did not need a protector. And the Metropole represented merely a check on the power they believed they had fairly won for themselves. ",
            "Nowhere was this through the looking glass version more apparent than in the attitude of Sonthonax himself. Remember, he had concluded as soon as he arrived in Saint Domingue back in 1792 that the only people he could really trust were the coloreds. Well, since emancipation, he had changed his mind completely. The slew of colored deffections to the British had really ticked him off. And then, stepping off the boat to find that General Villatte had just staged a coup against Lavaux, Sonthonax now identified the coloreds not as the Republic’s best friends in Saint Domingue, but their worst enemy. Well, aside from the British. The Third Commission had been sent to keep Saint Domingue free and keep Saint Domingue French. And the coloreds now clearly stood in the way of that mission. ",
            "So if not the coloreds, now, who does Sonthonax now see as his potential best friend in Saint Domingue? Well, the blacks. And there is no doubt that the black community was 100% ready to be Sonthonax’s best friend. They all knew Sonthonax, they all loved Sonthonax. He was the emancipator. The undisputed claim to leadership of the blacks that Toussaint had been cultivating was suddenly challenged by a very credible rival. A rival who had freed all the slaves and then fought for the Republic that had guaranteed that freedom at a time when Toussaint wanted nothing to do with it and was in fact fighting against it. ",
            "So Toussaint met with Sonthonax and said all the right things. But I have to imagine that from their very first meeting, Toussaint was trying to figure out a way to get Sonthonax the hell off the island. Now, luckily for Toussaint, with the coloreds identified as Problem A1, there was no need to rush into a confrontation just yet. And the Third Commission did indeed begin with the problem of what to do with the coloreds. So right away they ordered General Villatte tracked down and arrested, which they appeared to have done in very short order, because Villatte was then put on a boat and deported back to France for trial. Now, I can’t for the life of me figure out exactly what happened to him after that. But obviously something about the constantly changing state of revolutionary politics back in Paris led Villatte to not be convicted of anything, because he’s going to return to Saint Domingue as one of the rehabilitated colored exiles accompanying the Leclerc expedition sent by Napoleon to take back control of the colony from Toussaint Louverture. But now I’m getting ahead of myself. ",
            "After dealing with Villatte, the Third Commission then turned to the problem of André Rigaud in the south. Aside from Toussaint, Rigaud had been the most important ally the French Republic had in the colony and Polverel certainly trusted him enough to hand over kind of emergency absolute authority in the south to Rigaud. But now that the Third Commission had arrived, it was time to cancel that emergency authority and restore normalcy. And what the Commission meant by normalcy was military officers not having independent authority to just do whatever they wanted. They would have to answer to the commissioners. So Sonthonax put together a small delegation to go down to Les Cayes and investigate the situation as a first step towards winding down Rigaud’s emergency dictatorship and restoring normal government. ",
            "But curiously enough, for this mission, not one of the five commissioners went along. Instead, Sonthonax picked some locals to go, and specifically some white locals who turned out to be really bad men for the job as they are about to make a giant mess of things. Now, I suppose it’s credible that Sonthonax wanted to stay in Le Cap, where he had spent the majority of his life in the colony. And you obviously don’t want to send Raimond down there if your intention is to rein in the coloreds. Philippe Roume, meanwhile, was already heading over to Santo Domingo to begin the process of transferring authority of the whole island from the Spanish to the French, because remember, that’s also supposed to be happening. And then the other two guys had no ties or connections or special knowledge whatsoever. So instead of any of the commissioners going, Sonthonax picked these white locals to go down. ",
            "Now, I don’t want to get too deep into these guys because they’re going to come and go very quickly, but one of them was a guy named André Rey. And in 1791, Rey had been one of the most vocal pro-white anti-colored agitators in the whole colony. Rigaud actually suspected that when the white-colored civil war broke out in 1792, that Rey had tried to assassinate him. Meanwhile, one of the other guys was known to be nothing more than an opportunistic con man. So if the Third Commission thought these guys were going to do anything but bungle the job and provoke a major crisis, well, they thought wrong. ",
            "But accompanying this little delegation was also a senior French military officer named General Desfourneaux, who was ordered to bring Rigaud’s Legion of the South into the regular army command structure. ",
            "This delegation arrived in the south a few weeks later and started stirring up trouble immediately. Before they even entered Les Cayes, they first went round on an inspection tour of the plantations of the south, and everywhere they went, they intentionally stoked black resentment of the coloreds. They told the black cultivators that they were all being exploited by the coloreds and that these rules and accompanying punishments were not what France wanted for them, that Rigaud and the boys are planning on restoring slavery the first chance they get. And I’m sure you’ve noticed by now that from here on out, everyone is going to be telling the blacks that the other side wants to put you back in chains. When this delegation then got into Les Cayes, they made an inspection of the city’s jail and discovered there were 900 prisoners, 898 of whom were either white or black. It would appear that in Rigaud’s regime, coloreds did not go to jail for anything. ",
            "So with very little tactical diplomacy, the delegation began to assert a new governmental structure. And then Desfourneaux told Rigaud that the days of running a truly independent command without oversight were done. And you now have higher ups you need to be taking orders from. Rigaud and his colored allies were not going to take this lying down, but to prevent them from organizing any real resistance, Desfourneaux announced that Rigaud and the Legion of the South were to undertake an immediate offensive into the mountains of the Grand-Anse surrounding British-held Jérémie. ",
            "Now, I am totally willing to believe that given the nature and attitude of the delegation, that this offensive was not just meant to distract Rigaud, but discredit him and his men. The offensive had very little chance of success. If you look back to Episode 3.40 on the French Revolution, we are now at the point in the war back in Europe where the British have elected to abandon land action on the continent and focus entirely on the naval war. Well, part of that new focus was booting the French out of the Caribbean for good. And by July 1796, 12,000 British reinforcements were now arriving in Saint Domingue. So when Rigaud attacked, he was attacking fortifications as well manned and well armed as they had ever been. When the assault failed, Desfourneaux put the blame squarely on Rigaud incompetence and the lack of patriotic resolve in the Legion of the South. Desfourneaux then ordered the arrest of a few of the principal colored leaders in Les Cayes to complete the hostile takeover by these agents of the Third Commission. And this was all finally too much for the coloreds. ",
            "With Rigaud still on his way back from the failed campaign, coloreds in and around Les Cayes, led by Rigaud’s brother, by the by, rose up in armed rebellion. And to build up their ranks, they marched around the plantation surrounding Les Cayes and told all the black cultivators, you guessed it, the delegates have lied. France means to reimpose slavery, and these delegates are here to put you back in chains. Soon they had raised an army nearly 4,000 strong and marched into Les Cayes. On August 11, 1796, they entered the city and let loose their fury on any white they saw, unleashing a full blown massacre. André Rey and General Desfourneaux managed to get on a boat and they sailed over to Santo Domingo. But the other delegates were not so lucky. Though they were able to seek refuge with General Bauvais, who put them under his, quote, unquote, “protection”. Then Rigaud came marching back into Les Cayes with 3,000 or 4,000 men of his own. He met with the delegates and they begged him to stop the killing and restore order by any means necessary. Rigaud promptly stopped the killing, and when it was done, about 300 whites lay dead in the street. But Rigaud then expelled the delegates from the south and sent them back to Le Cap with a message that “Because things are still so unsettled, I’m just going to go ahead and maintain my emergency authority until further instructions come from France.”",
            "When these guys made it back to Le Cap, Sonthonax in particular was furious and denounced Rigaud’s actions, but there was very little he could do beyond stomp his feet. The principal enemy in Saint Domingue really was the British. And without Rigaud, there would be no expelling the British. And it certainly would be insane to try to break Rigaud by force at this point. That would be a disaster for everyone. So for the moment, Rigaud holds his little de facto dictatorship. ",
            "While these events unfolded in the south, the Third Commission busied itself restoring normalcy in the north. The Third Commission, broadly speaking, adopted Toussaint’s vision for the future of Saint Domingue. The three races must all have a place, but the plantation economy must also be maintained, and the blacks must be the principal laborers. But they did adopt one of Rigaud’s innovations: that truly abandoned plantations that had reverted to the state should be leased out to private individuals. It seemed to provide the best incentive to get them back up and running and provide the government with a revenue stream. But unlike in the south, where connections to Rigaud were key, in the north, public auctions would be held. Now, obviously, this still means that men with money are going to dominate the auctions. But Sonthonax had hopes that in the end, Saint Domingue might become a mixed blend of Toussaint’s vision for the future and then that fifth option we talked about last time – blacks living and working for themselves. Sonthonax hoped that black cultivators and foreman might be able to pool their resources and put in collective leases on property. But when the bidding started, none of those collectives have the resources to compete with the real men of means. And who were the real men of means now in the north? Well, a new elite caste is forming that is about to become majorly, hugely important: black army officers. ",
            "As I’m sure you’ve noticed by now, the difference between being a slave and being a cultivator isn’t that huge. And the money you made was never going to be enough to really allow you any kind of upward mobility. If you were a cultivator, there was a 99% chance you were going to remain a cultivator until the day you died, and then your kids were going to become cultivators after you. The only institution in Saint Domingue that offered a black man any chance of bettering his lot in life was the army. If you showed some talent, you could rise to be an officer. Bigger share of the plunder, better opportunities for economic and social advancement. And it’s right here, in mid 1796, that we really see the fruits of this begin to be harvested. Toussaint himself acquired the first of many plantations he would come to own in his life. Then his chief, lieutenant, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who I swear I’ll introduce more fully when the time is really right, started buying and leasing property all over the colony. Their fellow officers then joined them in property acquisition. And by the end of the year, you had your first batch of ex-slaves vaulting into the ranks of the planter class. ",
            "Julien Raimond, ever the pragmatist, couldn’t resist the deal when he saw it and acquired extensive new holdings at the same time. And if you remember from way back when, the Raimond family fortune had been built by acquiring abandoned plantations. So this was all right in his wheelhouse. ",
            "Adding to the slow entrenchment of a new elite in Saint Domingue were the rules of who would have a political voice in the new system. The Third Commission had orders to hold elections to select Saint Domingue’s delegates to the Council of Five Hundred. And there were now property requirements to be a voter. Remember, when the Directory came to power, they brought with them the old active passive citizen distinction. In 1796, maybe 5% of the population of Saint Domingue could actually meet those requirements. So acquiring property was not just about economic advantage, it was about political advantage. ",
            "When the elections got going in the fall of 1796 to elect delegates back to the Council of Five Hundred, Toussaint Louverture canvassed hard for his two favorite candidates, Governor General Lavaux and Commissioner Sonthonax. You know, the two guys who stood in the way of his own upward trajectory. Now, Lavaux, for his part, was perfectly amenable to being elected. He was coming up on his fourth anniversary in command of Saint Domingue, and not one single day of it had been easy. He had fought in street riots against angry whites and pitched mountain battles against black insurgents, and he had fought the British and the Spanish, he had been the target of a coup. Lavaux was probably pretty tired, and I would not blame him. But Toussaint also pitched his candidacy in terms of making sure that there was a voice back in Paris who could defend Toussaint’s tricolor future for Saint Domingue, a vision of the future shared by Lavaux. So Lavaux said, all right, let’s do it. And he was elected. Also elected on this slate were Louis Dufay and Jean-Baptiste Belley, who were already, of course, still in Paris, ready to just roll into their new offices. And then, yes, Sonthonax was elected. ",
            "Unlike Lavaux, Sonthonax was really resistant to this idea. He had just gotten back to Saint Domingue and believed that he was essentially coming back to complete his life’s work. Going back to Paris was the last thing he wanted to do. But Toussaint was able to convince enough voters that Sonthonax was the best man to have back in Paris, speaking French to the French government on their behalf. Leave Creole business to the Creoles back here in Saint Domingue. So, against his will, Sonthonax was elected a delegate to the Council of Five Hundred. But though elected, he refused to leave. He said, “I am going to stay and complete my term as Commissioner.” So in October 1796, Governor General Lavaux boarded a ship to go back to France and took with him Toussaint’s two sons who were to be educated in France, but Sonthonax did not join them. ",
            "But though the rivalry between Toussaint and Sonthonax was now growing, on the surface, they remained allies. And so when Lavaux left Sonthonax named Toussaint commander in chief of all the French forces in Saint Domingue, And, I mean, who else could he choose? Any other candidate likely would have provoked a whole new rebellion. ",
            "So we’re going to leave everyone there for now. Toussaint is now commander in chief of all the military forces in Saint Domingue, but he still has to contend with Sonthonax. André Rigaud is still running the south as a personal dictatorship, and the reinforced British continued to occupy territory across the west and south provinces. And I sure hope nothing happens back in France to upset this new balance of power.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "As 1797 dawned, Toussaint Louverture was arguably the most powerful man in Saint Domingue. But though he may have been the most powerful man, that did not make him the only powerful man. His influence did not extend into territory held by his ally, André Rigaud, nor to territory held by his enemy, the British. And then, even in the North Province, where Toussaint did wield enormous influence, there was still a check to his total authority in the form of Sonthonax. But Toussaint did have the most troops. He controlled all the best property, both the rich Northern Plains and the slowly rebuilding city of Le Cap. So in a complicated game of politics played out from the fields of Saint Domingue to the halls of the Directory in Paris, Toussaint grabbed opportunities when they arose to make himself not just the most powerful man, but the only powerful man in Saint Domingue. ",
            "Now, there is no doubt that for the moment Third Commissioner Sonthonax was the biggest obstacle now standing in front of Toussaint. Toussaint had successfully engineered the Commissioner’s election to the Council of Five Hundred. But when Sonthonax said, “No, I’m going to stay and maybe I’ll go home in the spring”, Toussaint must have been annoyed, but he could not press the issue. Sonthonax was a living symbol of black liberation and that had to be tread lightly around. Not all blacks were excited to be returning to the plantations under all these labor codes. And all through 1796, armed revolts had popped up from time to time and Toussaint had to rush in to stop them from spreading. And he did not miss that some of these insurgents chanted “Long live Sonthonax!” as they took up arms. So for Toussaint, getting rid of the emancipator was going to be a tricky business. Misplay it and the blacks might rise up against him. ",
            "But though Sonthonax remained, he was the only French emissary Toussaint had to worry about. Lavaux had gone back to France to take up his seat in the Council of Five Hundred. Third Commissioner Philippe Roume remained in Santo Domingo, overseeing the transfer of Spanish authority. Though, just so you know, the Spanish are really dragging their feet about this and the French don’t really have the forces to compel them to do anything for the moment. The other two commissioners, who never did anything, went home without having ever done anything. So, of the five members of the Third Commission, only Julien Raimond and Sonthonax remained. And Raimond had decided firmly that Toussaint was the future of Saint Domingue. Whatever sympathy he may have had for André Rigaud never had much of a chance to express itself. Raimond was in the north, under Toussaint’s military auspices, and he was currently taking advantage, along with Toussaint’s officers, of all these land auctions. So Raimond was not a threat to Toussaint’s authority and was, in fact, now a staunch ally. ",
            "Meanwhile, the rapid fire spins of the French Revolution presented Toussaint with both a mortal threat to all that he was trying to accomplish and a golden opportunity to get rid of Sonthonax and see the project through to completion. We are now at Episode 3.46 of The French Revolution. The first round of elections for the open seats in the legislative councils of the Directory are about to unfold in March and April 1797. And as you may recall, this election turned out to be a crushing defeat for the old Thermidorians and a great victory for a new breed of conservative reactionary. Coming into the Council of Five Hundred, amidst this conservative sweep were a number of prominent colonial landowners – the old big whites, who were absolutely set on reversing the course of liberty and equality in Saint Domingue and restoring the rightful order of things: white supremacy and slavery. ",
            "After taking up their seats in the Council of Five Hundred, these guys wasted little time. And in May and June 1797, a succession of colonial planters rose to denounce the state of Saint Domingue, putting the blame for everything on, first, racial equality and then slave emancipation. These men painted a vivid portrait of a once lucrative colony in ruin. Where once thriving industrialized plantations had pumped out the sugar and coffee that made the whole world go round, there are now stood burnt out plantations overgrown with weeds, tended by indolent blacks who just lay around. Fields were being planted with rudimentary tools and then ill tended thereafter. The city of Le Cap was a burnt out husk of its former self. The colony would never be what it was and what France needed it to be until the crimes of equality and emancipation were avenged. These planters called for a military force to go back to Saint Domingue and put things back the way they should be. And they even got so far ahead of themselves that they demanded the Republic cover the planters costs as they rebuilt their slave plantations. ",
            "These planter delegates also took steps to ensure that there was no voice in the Council of Five Hundred to oppose their picture of Saint Domingue. As the Legislative Councils of the Directory convened, the planters’ interest challenged the credentials of the representatives from the colony, preventing Dufay and Belley and Lavaux from taking up their seats. So there was no one directly connected to the colony who could stand up and defend everything that had happened since emancipation. ",
            "Now, the Directory was not 100% moved by these speeches, but they were not deaf to them either. And part of it had to do with the changing international picture, because where we are at in the revolutionary wars is that General Bonaparte has just beaten the Austrians and imposed the Leoben preliminaries. If this last foreign enemy was really removed, sending an army to Saint Domingue to reassert the old colonial order was not totally out of the question. Nor, given the state of the Directory’s finances, was the prospect of a productive Saint Domingue pumping out sugar and coffee again, odious to the directors. The reactionary planters managed to score one early victory when they pinned everything on Sonthonax and his radical ilk. And in June, they induced the Council of Five Hundred to recall the Third Commission. With a new political climate in Paris, Sonthonax was going to have to come home and defend himself all over again. ",
            "Now, the reactionary planters in the Council of Five Hundred weren’t totally right in the picture that they painted of Saint Domingue in the spring of 1797, but they weren’t totally wrong either. There is no doubt that the cash crop export economy of Saint Domingue had fallen off a cliff after 1791, when everything had been consumed by fire and civil war. It was also becoming clear that the plantations that were restarting were never going to be as productive as they had once been. Men like Toussaint and Sonthonax and the now departed Lavaux believed that they could bring the plantations back to life by creating a system of shared prosperity. And Toussaint in particular urged returning white and colored plantation owners that fostering the love of the cultivators would be more productive than the fear that they had fostered in their old slaves. But at the moment, Saint Domingue was in a vicious economic cycle that prevented this dream from becoming a reality. The colony had always been so focused on sugar, coffee and indigo that Saint Domingue had never been self-sufficient. It relied on imported foods and supplies to live. Imports paid for with the profits of the exports, but with exports nowhere to be found, the imports dried up. ",
            "Now the other problem is that as much as Toussaint encouraged the rebuilding of destroyed plantations, there was only so much that could be done. All the heavy machinery and special equipment to produce all the really good refined sugar could not just be built from scratch. It had to be crafted and forged, and a lot of it had been built back in France. Who was going to pay for all that or wait for it to show up? ",
            "Anxious new cultivators were more worried about whether they would have enough to eat that night than Toussaint’s long term vision for the future. And many turned away from plantation work to continue raising their own crops. Many also decamped to the mountains to live in peaceful maroon communities, if they could even be called maroons anymore. Focused on the immediate needs of self-sufficiency, these communities cleared parts of the forest to build homes and plant crops, beginning a process of total deforestation which modern Haiti still reels from. And with corporal punishment now banned, the once omnipresent whip set aside, it was harder to get men and women to perform work they really didn’t want to perform, especially when they were hungry and just wanted to eat. ",
            "Also standing in the way of a reborn economy was something we talked about last week, that the life of a cultivator led nowhere. Meanwhile, the life of a soldier had the possibility of advancement. So young men of prime working age wasted no time picking life in the army over life in the fields. Adding up everyone together from across the colony, that is, those serving under Toussaint and Rigaud and the British, something like 25% of the black men in the colony were underarms, as much as 15% of the total population. And as these soldiers continued their lives under arms, they developed the soldier’s habit of taking what they could not make. Cultivators both on plantations and then free blacks living on their own both faced constant harassment and expropriation from the soldiers. And the divide between the military and civilian wings of Haitian cultural life began to grow. ",
            "Sonthonax tried to alleviate some of these structural problems, and he made efforts to erect a civil infrastructure to help bring up the next generation of free citizens into a world where they would not be subject to the whims of the wealthy and powerful. And one subtle new rule forbade the use of the word ‘freedman’ to describe an ex-slave. Sonthonax hoped to permanently erase any stigma that came with slavery, even an acknowledgment that it had once been overcome. ",
            "Then Sonthonax and Raimond got started on a program of education reform, though reform isn’t actually a very good word for it. More like education conjured from the ether. The colonial administrators from the very beginning had viewed schools in the colony to be purely seditious institutions, and this is part of the reason why all those prominent colored families had sent their kids back to France for schooling, men like Raimond and Rigaud. There were literally no primary or secondary schools in the colony, and that’s exactly how the Metropole wanted it. So Sonthonax established the first school in Le Cap to serve as a model for what he hoped would be a network of schools that would provide an education for the population. He also wrote back to France begging for teachers and textbooks and resources. But unfortunately, Sonthonax was never able to follow through on the project and schools quickly lost out to the army when it came time to disperse state funds. ",
            "The commissioners also worked to set up legal courts and as many towns and municipalities as they could to try to introduce the rule of law into a colony that had long been governed by little more than brute force. If the cultivators were going to have rights, they needed to have a judicial system they could count on to address their grievances and rectify them. But here, the broader problem of an uneducated population rose its head as Sonthonax struggled to find men who were educated enough to staff these courts. Especially because those who did have an education were drawn from the wealthy planter class, so they could never be trusted to just follow the law where it led them. So the reach of and the population’s faith in these new courts was limited, to say the least. ",
            "Through this period, the winter and spring of 1797, Toussaint and Sonthonax worked in harmony with each other publicly and even privately seemed to get along okay, though Sonthonax did keep requesting that Toussaint demobilized some of his soldiers to get those young men back to work. And Toussaint kept dragging his feet because, yeah, that’s not going to happen. It was clear to everyone that military might was still the key to power in Saint Domingue and Toussaint was not just going to disband the center column of his own support. Sonthonax was also persistently angry about the generous welcome Toussaint kept giving to returning white planters. Many of those guys had fled the colony specifically because they were mortal enemies of the Second Commission. So Sonthonax was not at all pleased when Toussaint welcomed these guys back as if nothing had ever happened. But Toussaint and Sonthonax did share some broad principles and really neither could afford to alienate the other. ",
            "Then, in mid-summer 1797, the text of one of the speeches made by the reactionary planters in the Council of Five Hundred made its way back to Saint Domingue. And Toussaint started formulating a plan to both hold off reactionary attempts to undo all that he was working for and solidify his position as the sole leader of Saint Domingue. ",
            "The first thing he did was write a long response to the speech that would be submitted to the Council of Five Hundred. Toussaint issued a point by point rebuttal of the planter arguments. Aside from the obvious point that the free blacks are now the Republic’s military force in the colony, so you want to be very careful about who you try to put back in chains. Toussaint also pointed out that the white property owners were finding life in the colony productive and beneficial. He said that if the white planters really wanted to make money again, they should embrace their free labor force, not continue to alienate them with threats of reimposed slavery. And God help you if you ever try to act on any of those threats. ",
            "The planters in Paris had also made the claim, though, that the blacks were too stupid and vicious to be trusted as free citizens. To which Toussaint said, “Hey, we might be uneducated, but we’re not stupid. So educate us and we’ll be as upright a population of citizens as you’ve ever seen.” As to the vicious part, Toussaint took a pretty delicious swipe at the French. He said, “If the crimes committed by the inhabitants of Saint Domingue precluded their right to be free citizens, then, my God, what about you lot back in Paris?” Toussaint was well briefed on the course of the terror. So if the existence of bloody crime stains us, then it must really super stain you. So what right do any of you have to be free citizens? And this argument in particular is pretty ingenious, because the Thermidorian Republic was all about distancing itself from the terror, and burying it all with Robespierre. So if any group was open to the argument that the crimes committed in the heat of revolt and revolution ought not stained the leaders of the present, it was the men who ran the Directory. ",
            "After dispatching this letter, Toussaint also prepared to make a peace offering to the conservatives that would solve a number of problems in one fell swoop. Because there was no one the planters hated more than Sonthonax. And Toussaint could see that as long as Sonthonax represented the new order in Saint Domingue, the hatred of Sonthonax would transfer to hatred of the new order. Emancipation and Sonthonax were just too closely tied. But if Sonthonax could be cut out, Toussaint might be able to make an independent case for following through with liberty and equality. And the amazing thing here is just how prescient Toussaint is in immediately grasping the political situation back in Paris and then using it to his advantage. Because, unbeknownst to everyone in Saint Domingue, in mid-summer 1797, the Council of Five Hundred had just voted to recall Sonthonax, just as Toussaint was getting ready to expel the Commissioner from the colony. ",
            "Now, the details of the expulsion of Sonthonax are obscure. And unfortunately, the best picture we have of what happened came from Toussaint’s later official version, so you kind of take it all with a grain of salt. But here’s what we do know: In mid August, Toussaint and a few of his principal generals got together and decided that the time had come to force Sonthonax to take up his position in the Council of Five Hundred. Toussaint also enlisted the aid of Julien Raimond, who agreed to try to convince Sonthonax to leave. To justify the expulsion, Toussaint revealed that Sonthonax had approached him on numerous occasions with a plan to raise the blacks in a new uprising whose principal objective would be to murder all the whites and then declare independence. Now, it’s pretty likely that this is a wild pack of lies concocted by Toussaint, but it did line up with the prejudice against Sonthonax that was growing in the Council of Five Hundred and that was really the only thing that mattered. ",
            "Toussaint and his generals presented a letter to Sonthonax on August 17, 1797, demanding the commissioner vacate the island. Sonthonax stalled for three days. But on August 20, Toussaint grew impatient and apparently fired off some of the heavy guns in Le Cap to jolt Sonthonax to action. There is also a reporting here of a closed door meeting between Toussaint and Sonthonax from which Sonthonax emerged ready to depart the island. The threats made must have been dire and immediate. ",
            "Now, one of the reasons Sonthonax stalled, though, is that he wanted to Toussaint to write a letter of support for Sonthonax that he could take with him back to the Council of Five Hundred. A request Toussaint refused. And not only did he refuse the request, he did the exact opposite. He wrote another long letter to the Directory denouncing Sonthonax, detailing Sonthonax’s plans to massacre the whites and declare independence. And he said “For these heinous crimes that I have uncovered and as a defender of the French Constitution, I have now expelled him from the island.” So Toussaint has now positioned himself as the ally of the white planter interest in the colony, and then, given the reactionary conservatives back in the Council of Five Hundred, their most hated enemy on a silver platter. And he reinforced the image of Toussaint Louverture as the Republic’s point man in Saint Domingue. There is a genuinely impressive cunning to how Toussaint operated. I mean, here, in this instance, he is not just eliminated arrival, he has simultaneously co-opted his enemy’s position and enhanced his own position with one deft maneuver. So Sonthonax got on board a ship in August 1797 and sailed away from Saint Domingue. And this time, he would never return. ",
            "But by the time Sonthonax and Toussaint’s letter reached Paris, the Directory had already been hit by its most important coup, the Coup of Fructidor , which we also discussed in Episode 3.46. Fructidor was the coup that saw the Directory abandon democratic pretensions and reforge itself as the so-called Second Directory, run by the triumvirate of Barras, Reubell and La Révellière. But the more immediate upshot of the Coup of Fructidor was that among the deputies expelled from the Council of Five Hundred were nearly all the white planters who had just spent the summer railing against liberty and equality. With them out of the picture, the threat of a white conservative attempt to reseize Saint Domingue was temporarily put to bed. And just as they were getting kicked out, the delegates from Saint Domingue had their credentials approved. So now, for example, the men most committed to colonial matters were men like Lavaux, Dufay and Belley, who were never going to argue for anything less than the continuation of liberty and equality. For example, when Lavaux took up his seat, he defended Toussaint to the hilt. He said “Toussaint is the only reason the colony is still French. And I understand that better than all of you because I was actually the principal military officer in the colony and I’m telling you, Toussaint is not the enemy of the Republic.” He also said that Toussaint’s tricolor vision for Saint Domingue was awesome and given the circumstances, an amazingly good deal for white planters specifically and then France generally. I mean, all that’s happened is that these men have lost the right to call black men property. The rest of their property has not been seized. It’s being handed back to anyone who wants to come claim it. If we all get together and embrace this move away from punishment and exploitation and hate towards a future built on reward and shared prosperity and mutual affection, everything is going to be great. ",
            "With the political situation back in France once again altered, that meant that whatever firestorm Sonthonax believed he was about to walk into was already extinguished by the time he got off the boat in October. Sonthonax did defend himself by saying that Toussaint was a tyrant in the making and you can’t trust what he’s telling you, which isn’t totally inaccurate. The charges that Sonthonax was conspiring to kill the whites and make himself governor general of an independent Saint Domingue – that was almost certainly lies. But the Directory had no personal beef with Sonthonax or the job he had done and they declined to pursue any punitive measures against him. But this does mark the end for Sonthonax in our story and he gets the rare peaceful ending to a revolutionary career. He retired from public life back to his hometown and there lived happily and in comfort for 16 more years before dying in July 1813. ",
            "Outside the very small world of people interested in the Haitian revolution, which I’ve now roped all of you into, by the way, no one knows who Sonthonax is, nor what he did. Even in Haiti, the natural course of patriotic history emphasizes the role played by the blacks and colored leaders in emancipation while downplaying the role of some random white French guy, which is totally understandable. But Sonthonax does deserve his place in world history and hopefully I’ve done my little part here to make sure that he gets the recognition that he deserves. ",
            "But back in Saint Domingue, Toussaint himself was ignorant of the Coup of Fructidor. And so in November 1797, he drafted another long letter that laid out both the promise of a free and equal Saint Domingue and issuing some none too subtle warnings about the dangers of trying to undo it. Since it’s arguably Toussaint’s most famous declaration of principles, I’m going to quote it in full a bit here. But before I do, I want to clarify that when I say that Toussaint is drafting these letters, what he’s actually doing is dictating his thoughts in Creole and then having secretaries translate it into formal French. Now, this could be a very time consuming process that required a lot of dialogue between Toussaint and the secretaries to make sure it said what Toussaint wanted it to say. But he understood just how important it was to convey his ideas and plans and demands in clear educated French. And all of his correspondence from the very earliest stages of the slave revolt show the meticulous care he gave to presenting himself in educated language. ",
            "Toussaint began his November 5 letter with a denunciation of the white planters as the true enemies of the republic who are now covering themselves in false patriotism. He said: ",
            "“The attempts on that liberty, which the colonists propose, are all the more to be feared, because it is with veiled patriotism that they cover their detestable plans. We know that they seek to impose some of them on you by illusory or specious promises in order to see renewed in this colony its former scenes of horror.” ",
            "He then pivoted quickly to claiming to be the truest offender of the Republic himself and made his first hint that anyone back in France contemplating re-enslavement was going to find this a very difficult proposition. He said, ",
            "“[…] but they will not succeed. I swear it by all that liberty holds most sacred. My attachment to France, my knowledge of the blacks makes it my duty not to leave you ignorant either of the crimes which they mediate or the oath that we renew, to bury ourselves under the ruins of a country revived by liberty rather than suffer the return of slavery.”",
            "So basically, remember those 20,000 muskets you sent us? We will use them to defend liberty, FYI. ",
            "But then Toussaint definitely turned to a little ass kissing of the Directory to make sure they knew that he trusted their wisdom and judgment entirely. He said “It is for you, Citizen Directors, to turn from over our heads the storm which the eternal enemies of our liberty are preparing in the shades of silence. It is for you to enlighten the legislature, it is for you to prevent the enemies of the present system from spreading themselves on our unfortunate shores to sully it with new crimes. […] Your wisdom will enable you to avoid the dangerous snares which our common enemies hold out for you.” ",
            "Then Toussaint stabbed at the white planters where they were most obviously vulnerable to attack, that from the beginning they had conspired with the enemies of France, that by 1793 they were openly in league with the enemies of the new Republic. He said, “I send you with this letter a declaration which will acquaint you with the unity that exists between the proprietors of Saint Domingue who are in France, those in the United States, and those who serve under the English banner. And you will see there a resolution, unequivocal and carefully constructed, for the restoration of slavery.” Basically, you cannot take their claims of patriotism and love of liberty seriously. They are liars and traitors who are trying to use the English to reimpose slavery. ",
            "Toussaint then moved on to a neoclassical allusion to the supreme fidelity of a man to his country, even over that of his own children. And I don’t know how much of this is just Toussaint saying things or if he really knew, for example, what a hit Jacques-Louis David’s painting of Brutus waiting for his dead sons had been in France. But whether this was on purpose or accident, he hit the perfect note. And he is referring here now to the fact that his two sons have gone back to be educated in France and are now virtual hostages of the French. So he said, “You will see that they are counting heavily on my complacency in lending myself to their perfidious views by fear for my children. It is not astonishing that these men who sacrifice their country to their interests are unable to conceive how many sacrifices a true love of country can support in a better father than they, since I unhesitatingly base the happiness of my children on that of my country which they and they alone wish to destroy.”  ",
            "But even as he was directing all this vitriol at the planters, he’s also subtly warning the Directory, don’t you go thinking you can use my kids against me because it’s not going to work. And then, with all that said, he started rolling downhill towards his powerful conclusion. He said, ",
            "“Do the colonists think that men who have been able to enjoy the blessings of liberty will calmly see it snatched away? They supported their chains only so long as they did not know any condition of life more happy than that of slavery. But today when they have left it, if they had a thousand lives, they would sacrifice them all rather than be forced back into slavery again.” ",
            "Now, this is just kind of a general statement aimed at everyone and reiterating his earlier hint that re-enslavement would be a violent and futile exercise. ",
            "But then he did move quickly onto some more ass kissing by rhetorically agreeing that France would never do anything that horrendous. He said, “But no, the same hand which has broken our chains will not enslave us anew. France will not revoke her principle, she will not withdraw from us the greatest of her benefits. She will protect us against all our enemies; she will not permit her sublime morality to be perverted, those principles which do her most honor to be destroyed, her most beautiful achievement to be degraded, and by her Decree of 16 Pluviôs which so honors the humanity of the world.” ",
            "And then Toussaint concluded with the final famous kicker: ",
            "“But if, to re-establish slavery in Saint Domingue, this was done, then I declare to you it would be to attempt the impossible: we have known how to face dangers to obtain our liberty, we shall know how to brave death to maintain it.” ",
            "So what Toussaint has done here is first, remind everybody that reactionary big whites have been traitors to the Republic and have been traitors for quite some time. So don’t believe their lies. Second, I love the Republic, I will defend the Republic and I have no doubt that the Republic will defend me. Third, anyone who tries to reimpose slavery is going to face an army of free blacks who will fight to the last man to stop it from happening, and you are just not going to win that fight. Napoleon Bonaparte would, of course, discover that for himself soon enough. ",
            "The ironic thing about this carefully crafted letter is that the battle had already been won before Toussaint even drafted it. The Coup of Fructidor had tossed out the reactionary planters and let in Toussaint’s allies. And I doubt very highly that the Directory to whom the letter was addressed even read it. Before now, delegate Lavaux induced the Council of Five Hundred to reaffirm liberty and equality in the colonies. On January 1, 1798, they voted that French law would be implemented uniformly throughout the Empire and that all blacks and coloreds would enjoy the same rights as if they had been born in France. Though there was one small stipulation, that to enjoy these rights you had to be serving as a cultivator or a soldier or a tradesman, basically employed in some officially recognized productive activity. So though the Directory’s version of freedom wasn’t quite as sweeping as the national convention’s had been, it did line up perfectly with Toussaint’s vision for Saint Domingue. And he was no doubt very pleased to discover that everything he had wanted to come to pass from all the letters he had written over the course of 1797 had now come to pass. Sonthonax was gone, the reactionary whites have been smacked down and Toussaint has the full support of the Directory. ",
            "But though Toussaint has positioned himself as the Directory’s man in Saint Domingue, the future of the colony was still in doubt and now lay in a contest between the three principal forces left in the colony: Toussaint Louverture in the north, André Rigaud in the south and then the British, still occupying an archipelago of ports in between. But not for much longer. Next week, when they leave, the stage will be set for a final showdown between André Rigaud and Toussaint Louverture for control of Saint Domingue. ",

        "paragraphs": [
            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So we left off last time with the reaffirmation by the Directory in January 1798, that liberty and equality would remain core pillars of colonial policy. But if you’ll recall, the third pillar to the Directory’s colonial policy was unity. The goal of the Thermidorian Republic was to totally integrate Saint Domingue and every other French colony into the French nation – one and indivisible. So that meant that they weren’t going to tolerate the kind of independent authority currently being wielded by André Rigaud and Toussaint Louverture. Since first word of the Estates-General had reached Saint Domingue way back in 1788, nearly ten years ago now, powerful factions in the colony have been bucking the Metropole’s authority. Whatever faction happened to be most powerful in the colony at any given moment always seemed to have an eye on independence. First it was the whites, then it was the coloreds. And now that Toussaint Louverture has ascended to power, he’s clearly not interested in Paris telling him what to do. Now, the Third Commission had tried and failed to bring the colony in line as so many others had in the past. But in the spring of 1798, the French government decided to give it another shot. ",
            "Now, if you’re surprised to discover that Saint Domingue has been a hotbed of revolt and revolution for nearly a decade now, then this will really surprise you. We’re now approaching the fourth anniversary of Toussaint Louverture’s defection to the French. He’s now been a general of the Republic longer than he was a general in the slave insurgency. And in that time, he has been a loyal and faithful defender of the Republic. Lavaux never had to embellish the stories of Toussaint’s fidelity back in Paris, too much. It would appear that after the departure of Sonthonax, Toussaint had some expectation that the Directory would designate him, Toussaint Louverture, as the official representative of the French government in the colony. And it’s not like this would have been a bad idea. As we’ve seen, introducing French representatives who have never set foot in the colony has been a very dicey proposition. I mean, Toussaint was an able administrator. His vision for Saint Domingue was right in line with what the Directory wanted. He commanded the loyalty of the bulk of the armed forces. I mean, why bring in another blundering white man when I’m right here? I’m a brigadier general in your army, Commander in Chief of the colony. I’m not some random guy off the street. But instead, the Directory did send in another blundering white man who just blundered around. And amidst this blundering, Toussaint began to recognize that the interests of Saint Domingue and the interests of France might be permanently diverging. Which is both true, but also the conclusion that nearly every prominent leader in the colony had reached once they achieved local supremacy. It’s funny how that works. ",
            "Of fundamental importance to the growing strain between Toussaint and Paris was the course of the revolutionary wars, which in 1798, saw two super important developments. First, the British will withdraw from Saint Domingue. And second, the Quasi War between the United States and France will erupt. Both would have a profound impact on Toussaint’s decision making, as these two developments offered an opportunity to stop being forever economically and politically tied to the French. ",
            "So the British had begun their invasion of Saint Domingue back in the fall of 1793, with high hopes that they would be able to quickly pry the colony away from the French Republic, which was itself about to collapse anyway. When both the Republic and Saint Domingue proved themselves frustratingly resilient, the British settled in for an occupation that had now dragged on for years, with very little to show beyond the initial gains they had made. A renewed surge in 1796 saw more men and resources being sent to Saint Domingue, but they had yielded almost no tangible benefits. By the end of 1796, the Royal Ministry back in London was coming round to the idea that Saint Domingue might not be worth it. It was turning into a black hole for both money and soldiers. So, in early 1797, they dispatched a new general to take over and one of his key orders was to cut the cost of the occupation to the bones, to find local sources of revenue and recruit local troops, that is, black men to maintain the British occupation. ",
            "Now, I probably shouldn’t get off on a tangent here, but I’m going to do it anyway, because the General who showed up to take over the operation in February 1797 was a guy named John Graves Simcoe. Simcoe had joined the British army in 1770, just in time to get shipped to North America, where he was amongst those soldiers besieged in Boston during the opening round of the American War of Independence. He then became a captain commanding a regiment of grenadiers as the British chased Washington through New York and New Jersey in 1776. And then he was wounded at Brandywine in 1777 and holds the famous little distinction of being the officer who ordered his men not to fire on some fleeing Continentals, one of whom just so happened to be George Washington (and this is just one of many of Washington’s near death experiences during the war). Simcoe wintered in Philadelphia and then fought at Monmouth Courthouse in the spring of 1778. Then he stayed in the north when the war turned south, but did march down to Virginia to meet up with General Cornwallis’s army. So he was there for the surrender at Yorktown in 1781. In short, Simcoe was involved in a ton of the principal engagements of the American War of Independence and he wrote a full account of his actions that is an excellent primary source, and he is currently being portrayed as the principal villain in AMC’s revolutionary spy drama “Turn”, in case you happen to be watching it. ",
            "But if Simcoe was just some British officer who served in the American War of Independence, I wouldn’t be going off on this tangent. But as it turns out, Simcoe was also an abolitionist. During the war, he tried to raise a company of blacks to fight for the British, but new orders took him elsewhere before he could see the project through. After the war, Simcoe briefly joined Parliament, but was then appointed lieutenant governor of the new colonial zone of Upper Canada, which is basically modern Ontario. Upper Canada was created so that British Canada could develop independently from French speaking Quebec. In this new role, Simcoe played a key role in passing the Act Against Slavery in July 1793, the first legislated emancipation decree anywhere in the British Empire, beating Sonthonax’s general emancipation decree in Saint Domingue by about six weeks. The Act Against Slavery allowed current slaves to be kept as slaves, but stipulated that no new slaves could be brought into Upper Canada and that children born to slave mothers would be emancipated at the age of 25. So General Simcoe already has his own little place in the slowly grinding wheel of history that eventually crushed slavery. ",
            "After returning to England, he was finally posted now to Saint Domingue in February 1797, whereas I said, he was supposed to maintain the occupation on the cheap. And though official British policy was that slavery would be maintained in any areas they controlled, it’s not hard to see that Simcoe might be a more believable face for the British to be putting on their efforts as they tried to recruit more blacks to their cause. In the end, the British had about 6,000 black men under arms, which was more even than André Rigaud had in his Legion of the South. With these forces, Simcoe made a play at retaking Mirebalais and he did succeed in temporarily displacing Toussaint’s forces. But they couldn’t hold what they had taken and Toussaint was able to move back in. And though the British did fend off a furious attempt by Toussaint to retake Saint-Marc, shortly thereafter, they lost their hold on Port-au-Prince and Republican forces retook control of the capital. ",
            "So as the winner of 1797 set in, the British were like, this isn’t going anywhere, and they appointed a new new commander, one whose principal calling card was not that he was a friend of the blacks, but that he was incredibly skeptical of the British occupation and argued that it should be ended as quickly as possible. ",
            "But just to finish up with General Simcoe, though, he went back to England and in 1806 was named Commander in Chief of India, a post that he was supposed to take over from the recently deceased General Cornwallis, but Simcoe died in England before taking up the post. General Simcoe is a super interesting guy, so thank you for indulging that little tangent. ",
            "In the spring of 1798 then, two new generals arrived from Europe who would help define the next stage of the Haitian Revolution. The first was the aforementioned British General Thomas Maitland, who would bring with him a clever new British approach to the situation, which we’ll talk about at length here in a second. But first, I want to introduce our latest blundering white man from France: General Joseph d’Hédouville. ",
            "Hédouville was first of all, a noble. He joined the army of the Ancien Régime just before the Revolution, but had liberal enough notions that he stayed on as his brother aristocrats fled across the lines. He fought at Valmy and eventually became a brigadier general, but then spent 1793 bouncing in and out of the army as he was suspended, arrested, reinstated and arrested again, all due to his very suspicious nobility. He landed finally in jail once and for all and was likely on his way to the guillotine when Thermidor arrived and saved his life in July 1794. ",
            "Now, one thing I’ve mentioned a few times now is the lack of care that the various French governments have taken in selecting the senior military officers who they were sending to Saint Domingue. Governor Blanchelande was diligent enough, but he was weak and in over his head. That old man, whose name I can’t remember, was outmaneuvered by the Second Commission and sent home, like, three days after he got off the boat. And then Galbaud. Galbaud got the job as a total afterthought and proceeded to trigger the destruction of Le Cap and mass emancipation. Not exactly what he had been sent there to do. Their only really good appointment was Lavaux. Lavaux was solid, but it’s entirely likely that he got the job just because he was there already. So now we come to Hédouville, and once again, the lack of care in the selection process is going to make a mess of things. ",
            "Hédouville was nominated and confirmed by the Council of Five Hundred in April 1797, when colonial policy was being driven by the reactionary white planters, before they were all expelled in the Coup of Fructidor later in the year. But then after Fructidor, instead of reassessing the candidate chosen by the planters to impose French authority on the chaotic colony, the Directory just kept Hédouville on and let him go. They don’t appear to have ever wondered why the planters wanted Hédouville, nor if he was the right man to ensure that liberty and equality remained pillars of colonial policy. Because while Hédouville was liberal enough to have remained in the revolutionary army, he was totally retrograde on racial stuff and the small cadre of officers he brought with him shared his retrograde views. And you can just bet Toussaint Louverture is going to love that.",
            "Hédouville’s explicit mission was to reassert central control of the colony, that is, render it merely a Caribbean department, not an independent fiefdom. He was to restore property to white planters who had not been classified as emigrés. He was to make the colony economically productive again. But just to be clear about this, Hédouville is not coming in as a new Governor General, even though he himself was a military officer. He was a civilian administrator because part of this reasserting of central control was putting the military under civilian administration. Now, Hédouville knew that putting the Saint Domingue military under civilian administration had been attempted by the Third Commission. And in the south, it had been a disaster that led to the massacre of the whites in Les Cayes in the summer of 1796. And we know that he knew this because Hédouville carried an arrest warrant for André Rigaud, who the Metropole blamed for the massacre, though he did also carry verbal instructions to use the arrest warrant as a stick to bring Rigaud into line and that if Rigaud played ball, Hédouville could cancel the warrant. ",
            "So Hédouville’s first act as the Directory’s agent in the colony put both Rigaud and, even more, especially Toussaint Louverture on notice that they might have trouble with this new arrival. Rather than sailing into Le Cap directly, which was now run by Toussaint, Hédouville landed in Santo Domingo over on the old Spanish side of the island. Though it was still pretty much the Spanish side of the island – neither Spain nor France had spent much energy completing the colonial transfer. There was a small company of French officials led by Philippe Roume, who were now nominally in control. But in the main, life in Santo Domingo had not changed one little bit. It is generally supposed that Hédouville put in at Santo Domingo to get the lay of the land first and avoid immediately falling into the orbit of Toussaint Louverture. But while in Santo Domingo, he was given a very keen piece of advice by a French officer who had been serving on the island for years. Of Toussaint he said, “With him you can do anything. Without him, you are powerless.” Hédouville would learn that for himself soon enough. ",
            "With the arrival of Hédouville on the island, the new British general in charge of the occupation, Thomas Maitland, who appears to have done very little before arriving in Saint Domingue – he’s just an aristocratic officer who rose up the ranks, got to work on his plans for the reorientation of British policy. In April 1798, he sent emissaries to Toussaint with some big news: “I want to discuss the terms of a British withdrawal from the colony.” ",
            "Toussaint was obviously all ears, and even more so when he got the terms. All Maitland wanted was assurances that whites and coloreds who had been living in British occupied zones wouldn’t be punished as collaborators when the British pulled out. Since this was exactly the kind of generous reconciliation Toussaint was all about, these were almost flawless terms for him. And that was kind of the point: playing to Toussaint. What Maitland was trying to do most especially was snub Hédouville, who was, after all, the official representative of the French government, and deal straight with Toussaint. Maitland hoped to create a rift between the new French administrator and his commander in chief, and then also build up Toussaint’s ego a little bit. But Toussaint was nothing if not savvy, and he duly forwarded everything to Hédouville for consultation and approval. Hédouville said, “Yeah, this looks good. Keep negotiating and I’ll be over there soon to finalize the terms.” ",
            "But Toussaint didn’t want to wait for that. So he turned back to Maitland and said, “Let’s make the deal, and frankly, I will do you one better. You’ve had Frenchmen actively fighting under your banner for the past few years. Tell those guys they can come back into the fold without fear of reprisal.” And Maitland said, “Hey, that sounds great.” And before Hédouville got to Le Cap, the British had pulled their forces out of Saint-Marc and a few other ports in the west and south. The only zones they still occupied were the original two ports they had seized, Jérémie and Môle-Saint-Nicolas. Marching into Saint-Marc in particular must have been a triumphant moment for Toussaint. Twice he had failed to take the city in brutal battles. And true to his word, Toussaint did not exact reprisals on anyone. ",
            "When Hédouville finally got to Le Cap in June, he and Toussaint met face to face for the first time. Hédouville congratulated Toussaint for negotiating the British withdrawal. But when he found out the full details, he was pretty angry. Official government policy was that men fighting for the enemies of the Republic were classified as emigrés and forfeited their lands. They were liable to be executed, not rehabilitated. And this was to say nothing of the fact that Toussaint had closed the deal without him. But if Hédouville was angry with Toussaint, it was nothing compared to how angry Toussaint got with Hédouville and his staff. These guys apparently did very little to hide their disdain for blacks and coloreds. They were free and open with their slurs and insinuated that it sure was a good thing properly civilized white men were here to take over for the savages, playing dress up with military uniforms that they had probably found laying on the ground. They referred to Toussaint Louverture as, quote, “a monkey with a handkerchief on his head”. So unlike Sonthonax, who Toussaint had maneuvered to get out of the way while still basically agreeing with his principles, Toussaint started maneuvering to expel Hédouville while hating his guts at the same time.",
            "In July 1798 then, we get a fateful moment in the history of the Haitian Revolution. As a part of a general conference of the republican leaders, André Rigaud came up to Port-au-Prince, and from there he and Toussaint traveled together to Le Cap. It was the first time that these two men, who have been the dominant Creole leaders in the colony since 1793 have met face to face. We know nothing about what they talked about. But the general supposition is that they agreed to back each other if Hédouville really tried to take over the colony. At the subsequent meeting, they must have said all the right things though, because, for example, we never hear anything more about the arrest warrant for André Rigaud. Though it’s also possible that Hédouville could see that he had no way at all to execute the warrant anyway, since between them, Toussaint and Rigaud controlled every soldier in the colony. ",
            "After this meeting, Toussaint went back to the West Province in August to work with Maitland on the terms of the final final British withdrawal. And this time, Hédouville told him to stop negotiating with Maitland directly, and Toussaint just ignored him, much to Maitland’s evident delight. Maitland and Toussaint then held a personal conference at Môle-Saint-Nicolas. On the eve of the agreed British withdrawal, Maitland hosted a dinner and presented Toussaint with some parting gifts. And it was around the time of this meeting that Maitland and Toussaint talked real turkey, not the logistics of the British withdrawal, but what happens next. ",
            "Now, both men had an agenda, but for the moment, their agendas lined up pretty well. Toussaint was well aware that aside from labor troubles, the single biggest obstacle to reviving the colony’s economy was the British naval blockade. He was also aware that one of the biggest boost to the economy would be if that blockade was not only lifted, but if Saint Domingue could sell to British merchants. Now, this would, of course, be like treason against the French government, so we’re only talking hypotheticals here, but that sure would be nice. And Maitland agreed that it would be a very enlightened course of action. Now, the one thing that Maitland really wanted was to make sure that General Toussaint didn’t try to export slave revolution over to Jamaica. Now, Toussaint never appears to have really pursued this idea, but British spies knew that back in Paris, the Directory had been in favor of this idea and that inciting a slave insurrection in Jamaica was a part of Hédouville’s secret orders from the Directory. So Toussaint and Maitland struck a side deal. Toussaint pledged not to allow the gospel of slave revolution to spread to Jamaica and in exchange, the British would lift the naval blockade. There may in all of this even been some direct promises to back Toussaint if he wanted to make a bid for political independence. But Toussaint did not trust the British that far just yet. But the seed was planted. ",
            "So as Toussaint was cutting the beginnings of this independent foreign policy for Saint Domingue, Hédouville was going on an inspection tour of the provinces and was finding it very difficult to reestablish French authority. What he was trying to do at this point was take back direct possession of the lands that had defaulted to the state when their owners fled and restored that property to the original white owners, not counting those listed as emigrés. Now, I know what you’re thinking. What’s the problem with this? This has been Toussaint’s policy all along. And so it has been. But now a crucial wrinkle has been added. Land that had not yet been reclaimed was leased to Toussaint’s officers who now occupied and ran the plantations. And you can imagine their reaction when this cadre of racist French officers blundered in, trying to boot them out, bringing with them all the classic old racist tropes with them – that blacks are too lazy and dumb and shortsighted to run a plantation like a real civilized gentleman. ",
            "So when Hédouville complained to Toussaint, Toussaint said, “Yes, yes, I’ll look into it.” He even issued papers confirming the rightful ownership of property by such and such an old family. But then he never lifted a finger to enforce those papers. So we’re seeing a change in Toussaint’s attitude. He had been happy to let the whites come back. He welcomed them with open arms. But the window on that was drawing to a close now, because if he had to pick between white planters who had still not yet claimed their property and his senior officers who had, Toussaint was going to support his officers. ",
            "As a part of his economic revitalization program, Hédouville  also brought with him some pretty heavy new restrictions on the cultivators. His officers who were inspecting the plantations wrote mockingly of the cultivators, who focused on their garden patches rather than the cane fields, saying, “These animals only live for the moment. They can’t see the bigger picture.” – Missing, obviously, two key points. First, the economy of Saint Domingue was still in shambles and we actually do need food to eat. We can’t live on sugar. And then, of course, second *bleep* you, harvesting sugar stinks. We’re free citizens now and we don’t want to do it. If you want sugar so bad, you go harvest it, *bleep* hole. ",
            "So to make sure that the cultivators kept working, Hédouville implemented new labor codes requiring cultivators to stay on their plantations for a minimum of three years and up to six years in some cases with stiff penalties for moving around. And this was greeted with angry shock by the black community. Remember when Sonthonax had decreed emancipation? He had said “You have to stay on your plantation for one year.” Well, that year has come and gone a long time ago and many blacks had taken the opportunity to move around, either in search of better conditions or to reunite with family. And now suddenly we’re supposed to get locked back down again? It wasn’t hard to see that this might be a prelude to re-enslavement which was the omnipresent fear of the poor black community. And as we’ve seen, Toussaint himself was pretty cool with forcing the cultivators to work at cash crop planting and there is some speculation that he was all too happy to have Hédouville issue the unpopular decree and take all the heat for it, while Toussaint reaped the ultimate rewards.",
            "As Hédouville struggled to impose his will on a population and its leadership who were making it clear they did not care what he wanted, he also started to assert control over the military. Technically, he was the supreme authority in the colony and could promote and dismiss officers at will. So over the summer of 1798, when and where he could, Hédouville promoted white officers to replace blacks for a variety of pretexts with a focus most especially on securing the coastal garrisons. This attempt to take control of the military would prove to be his undoing. ",
            "In October, Hédouville’s racist blundering finally caught up with him at what used to be called Fort Dauphin. That’s where Jean-François had once massacred those French auxiliaries. It was now called Fort Liberty, because, you know, the French Revolution. The fort was pretty important and so Toussaint handed it over to one of his most trusted generals, Moyse. ",
            "Now, I can find very little solid background information on Moyse (alternative spelling: Moïse, Moise), except that he was a former black slave who had joined the original insurrection in 1791 and had quickly attached himself to Toussaint and then stayed attached to Toussaint ever since. The two had become so closely linked that Toussaint adopted Moyse as his nephew, which I’m not exactly sure how that works, but that’s what they say happened. The other really important thing that is always reported about Moyse is that among the black generals he was the one most sympathetic to the black cultivators. He was very popular in the black community and seemed genuinely interested in their wellbeing, more so certainly than Toussaint himself, which will become an issue down the road. At the moment though, the issue was between Moyse and Hédouville suspected that Moyse was fomenting some kind of rebellion against the new labor laws and in mid October a scuffle at Fort Liberty broke out between black and white soldiers and Hédouville seized on it as a pretext to remove Moyse from command. In his place, he appointed a white officer to run the military garrison and a black civil officer to run the town. ",
            "Now, whether Moyse was fomenting rebellion before this all happened is an open question. But after it happened, he definitely started to foment revolution, marching around the plantations of the Northern Plains and raising cultivators to help fight for him. He also sent an urgent dispatch to Uncle Toussaint, saying, “Hédouville is was making a power play. We have to stop him.” ",
            "So Toussaint ordered one of his other key generals, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, to lead a strong force down to Le Cap and arrest Hédouville. Dessalines surrounded Le Cap and Hédouville  was like, well, that’s it for me. The only way he was going to avoid being taken into custody and then God knows what after that, was to leave the island. So that’s what he did. On October 23, 1798, Hédouville and his little cadre of racist officers got on a boat and sailed away. Also taking this opportunity to bolt was Julien Raimond. He had supported Toussaint since his return to Saint Domingue. But Toussaint was obviously moving in an autocratic direction. And Raimond got out before he became a casualty of Toussaint’s ambition, which will unfortunately be the fate of Moyse. ",
            "Now once again alone to do his own thing without interference, Toussaint went back to charting his own course for Saint Domingue in the troubled international waters of the Western Hemisphere. Having secured a pretty good deal from the British, he now had to focus on Saint Domingue’s relationship with the United States. As we’ve seen, Yankee traders were just about the only merchants willing, or able, to do business with Saint Domingue, and they had been practically the sole conduit for colonial exports and imports since 1791. So you can just imagine how Toussaint felt when he found out about the XYZ affair, because that’s where we’re at now. Let’s see, we’re at Episode 3.48. Talleyrand has just demanded a massive bribe from the American ambassadors to do something about French attacks on American shipping, and the Puritanical Yankees have just gotten their panties in a bunch and walked out. This led to the Quasi War, which, as I mentioned, played out mostly between the two navies in the Caribbean, which means that this is all playing out right on top of Toussaint Louverture’s head and is really, really bad for business, because American merchants are now barred from coming to Saint Domingue ports. ",
            "In the United States, attitudes towards the French in general, and then Saint Domingue in particular, had changed since the refugee crisis of 1793. Anger over the XYZ affair had hardened public opinion against the French. And so when a new exodus of whites fleeing Port-au-Prince, just before it fell in mid 1797, landed in Philadelphia, they were treated with hostility and suspicion rather than sympathy and charity. Frenchmen with connections to Saint Domingue were amongst those specifically targeted, when the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts were passed in the spring of 1798. But this anger at the French didn’t 100% transfer to Saint Domingue. The northern merchants were suffering badly from the loss of trade with the colony, and they lobbied Congress to let them keep going. Meanwhile, over in London, the American ambassador to the Court of St. James, Rufus King, started talking this all through with his British counterparts and then wrote home recommending that if the Americans really wanted to hurt the French and simultaneously lessen the threat posed by this island of armed blacks, they should keep trading with Saint Domingue. Give all those ex-slaves an incentive to work, rather than forcing them in their desperation to take more drastic measures. This, of course, was great news for Toussaint Louverture and after expelling Hédouville, Toussaint was able to make his own case to the American government for maintaining trade. In November 1798, Toussaint made his first formal approach to the American government. He wrote a letter to President John Adams saying, “Look, this war has got nothing to do with me. We are not fighting you. We are not doing anything to you. In fact, all we are doing is being a great source of trade for your merchants. That is as lucrative for you as it is necessary for us. My goal will always be to protect American shipping, not attack it. Please lift the embargo.” ",
            "As a follow up to this letter, Toussaint dispatched two agents to Philadelphia. One a white merchant from Le Cap named Joseph Bunel, the other, the resident American consul in the colony, a guy named Jacob Meyer, who was willing to vouch for Toussaint in the coming negotiations. These two met with Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, who was happy to receive them because Pickering was a staunch Federalist and very pro British who absolutely had visions of breaking Saint Domingue away from France. And this all seemed like a golden opportunity to do just that. In January 1799, Bunel then finally met with Adams in person and made the case for lifting the embargo on Saint Domingue. But while he pleaded with Adams, a bill was already being drafted to do just that. The recent election of 1798 had played out in the midst of anti-French war fever, and the Federalists enjoyed their last happy election before being obliterated by the Jeffersonian Democratic Republicans in the years to come. But for the moment, the Federalists now controlled both the House and the Senate. So in February 1799, they passed a bill that first extended the trade embargo on the French, which was due to expire, and then second, allow the President, at his own discretion, to exempt certain regions from the embargo if those regions weren’t actively involved in the fighting. Everyone knew that this was all just code for Saint Domingue. And for the moment the bill was passed, it was referred to as Toussaint’s Clause. President Adams signed the bill into law, and American merchants were once again allowed to trade with Saint Domingue. Now, this is great news for Toussaint Louverture, though the deal was not without future dangers. In bilateral negotiations between themselves, the British and Americans concocted plans to protect trade with Saint Domingue by not allowing anyone but British and American ships to come and go. So ultimately, Toussaint was still at the mercy of powers beyond his control. And then the British and Americans also secretly agreed that this would only go on so long as the war with France did. After that, they would reappraise their relationship with Saint Domingue which, after all, was a country run by insurrectionary slaves which was a very bad example to be setting for the rest of the Western Hemisphere. ",
            "If Toussaint was planning to declare independence from France, he was off to a great start. He had the economic support now of both the British and Americans and was operating totally independently of the French government. He had secured his supply lines, he faced no foreign military threat for the first time since 1793 and he controlled the majority of the armed forces in Saint Domingue. So that can only mean one thing: it’s time for a final showdown with André Rigaud. ",
            "Rigaud and Toussaint had been working as partners officially for years. But as we discussed back in Episode 4.9, they had been quietly rivals for the loyalty of the blacks from the beginning and Toussaint clearly had the upper hand. It was also pretty obvious that once Hédouville got back to France that the Directory would send along another delegation or another commission, probably a bigger one this time and possibly backed by armed forces. If they decided that Toussaint was a real threat they could sail round and land in Les Cayes and then combine with Rigaud’s Legion of the South and push north. None of this was implausible. And I don’t know if Toussaint knew this at the time but on his way out the door, Hédouville had written an official dispatch to André Rigaud that was designed to sow his own seeds of disharmony and pave the way for a possible future joint operation against Toussaint. Ever since Toussaint Louverture had been promoted to lieutenant governor, he officially outranked Rigaud. The dispatch sent by Hédouville absolved Rigaud of any subordination to Toussaint. It said Toussaint is not your superior. He cannot tell you what to do. And Rigaud was no doubt very pleased to see this officially confirmed because he had never had any intention of letting Toussaint Louverture tell him what to do. ",
            "Next week, the final showdown for control of Saint Domingue will play out. Traditionally, the showdown has been described in strictly racial terms, that the blacks under Toussaint fight the coloreds under Rigaud. And while this is broadly true, it’s not really true. Rigaud had black supporters and allies. Toussaint had colored supporters and allies. And it’s not like Toussaint was fighting for black supremacy. He was still all about that tricolor vision for Saint Domingue. But we’ll get into all of that next week, when we delve into the War of Knives.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So last week, Toussaint Louverture not only rid himself of Joseph de Hédouville, the Directory’s official emissary to Saint Domingue, he also opened up independent diplomatic relations with both the United States and Great Britain, who were both at war (or at least quasi war) with France. This was a bold step towards total political independence, but Toussaint was not prepared to go all the way just yet. He rebuffed advances from both the British and Americans to declare independence. And in the wake of Hédouville’s departure, he instead called on the Third Commissioner, Philippe Roume, the last man carrying credentials signed in Paris, to leave Santo Domingo and come back to Le Cap, where he would be able to officially rubber stamp Toussaint’s policies. Roume reluctantly came back, and though he would half heartedly push back against Toussaint, there was nothing he could really do. So though Toussaint still hid behind a veneer of fealty to France, he paid them now even less mind than ever. ",
            "Now, as I somewhat cynically mentioned last week, through the whole course of the Haitian Revolution, whatever political faction happened to be on top tended to seek independence from France, while their rivals tended to seek greater ties to France. Now, I don’t know if Toussaint’s ultimate objective was, in fact, total political independence, but it is clear that he is now essentially playing for the program first advanced by the big whites, when they sent delegates to the Estates-General way back in 1789. Their goal had never been independence per se. What they were really after was home rule and the right to free trade. As long as they had those two guarantees in hand, remaining inside the French Empire was fine. They just wanted to replace the system where the superior metropole dominated the inferior colony and turned the French Empire into a confederation of autonomous units with a shared loyalty. Toussaint was now angling for almost this identical program. He didn’t need or want any more of the supposed superiors from France telling him what to do. And he wanted Saint Domingue to be able to trade with any power on earth. If I had to speculate, I’d say that Toussaint would have been fine running an autonomous Saint Domingue inside the French Empire rather than actively pursuing a clean break. And certainly the coming war with France would be forced on him by France. It was never anything that he truly sought. ",
            "Now, one thing we absolutely do know, however, is that Toussaint wanted to be the supreme and unchallenged master of the island of Hispaniola. And yes, as we will see here today, he wanted the whole island, not just Saint Domingue proper. And the only man on the island currently in a position to stand his way was André Rigaud. And now that their mutual enemy had been removed from the island, that is the British, the time had come for Toussaint to also remove Rigaud. ",
            "So of course, the flip side of the powerful political factions seeking independence was the weak political faction seeking closer ties to France and that is now right back where Rigaud has found himself. He and his free colored brethren had begun the Haitian revolution as the staunchest defenders of French authority as the big whites had used home rule as code for racial apartheid. When the whites had been expelled and politically neutralized the coloreds then briefly became the dominant political faction and it was they who brushed off French authority, most dramatically in 1796 with first the coup of General Villatte in Le Cap and then the massacre of all those white in Les Cayes later in the summer. While now that Toussaint has leapfrogged Rigaud in terms of power and prestige, it’s time for Rigaud and his colored allies to head back to the bosom of the Metropole. And in the coming battle with Toussaint, Rigaud would paint himself as the true defender of the French Republic who was battling against this usurper Toussaint, and in this he would cling to the dispatch issued by Hédouville in October 1798 that liberated Rigaud from his subordination to Toussaint and also clearly hinted that Hédouville would be advocating for Rigaud when he returned to France. So in the coming battle with Toussaint, André Rigaud would always keep one eye on the horizon desperately hoping that reinforcements would arrive from France. But spoiler alert these reinforcements are not coming. ",
            "Now, as I mentioned at the very end of last week’s show (right before the outro music didn’t kick in. I’m sorry about that. It should be fixed now), the civil war that’s about to begin between Rigaud and Toussaint, dubbed the War of Knives, is simplistically painted as a race war between the blacks and coloreds. And while this is kind of, sort of true, it’s not really, really true. I mean, we know that Rigaud was setting up a system of colored supremacy. But as open war approached, Rigaud was supported by black leaders in the west and north provinces who were disenchanted with Toussaint Louverture’s rule. There were plenty of blacks who believed that Toussaint was effectively betraying them back into slavery. These are the guys who had just recently chanted “Long live Sonthonax!” in 1796, much due Toussaint’s great annoyance. So Rigaud does have a pro-colored agenda, but his support orders are not only coloreds. And then more importantly on Toussaint’s side, we know that he was absolutely not pursuing black supremacy. He not only had all the whites in Saint Domingue supporting him, but he also had a fair number of coloreds – practical men, landowners and merchants and military officers who believe that Toussaint’s way forward really was the best way forward. Whatever racial solidarity they might have felt was subordinated to economic solidarity. Toussaint was fighting for all three races to live together and prosper together. This was not about exterminating the coloreds. So though it looks like a war between the blacks and the coloreds, it really wasn’t that at all. ",
            "But it’s also not surprising that history books would report the War of Knives as a race war, seeing as that’s how Toussaint painted it. As he and Rigaud waged a propaganda war in early 1799. Toussaint launched the first attack of this War of Words in February 1799, practically the minute that Toussaint’s clause was signed into law in Philadelphia, which guaranteed his access to trade with the United States and Britain. He issued an address that denounced Rigaud and the colored regime of the south. Toussaint said, as everyone in Saint Domingue now does, that Rigaud planned to re-enslave the blacks the first chance he got. Toussaint said, “I’ve been Rigaud’s superior officer for years now, but he won’t take orders from me because I’m a black man and Rigaud hates black men.” Toussaint also pointedly reminded everyone of the fate of the Swiss. The first slave fighters promised freedom by the coloreds who were then immediately betrayed. Toussaint said, “That’s Rigaud’s plan for all of us: use us to get power and then betray us back into chains.” Rigaud then fired back with an address of his own that said, “I cannot believe I’m the one being accused of hating blacks. I have fought for racial equality my whole life, you know sword in one hand, declaration of the Rights of Man in the other. Half my family is black. I was raised by blacks. I have fought alongside blacks. Toussaint Louverture is a two faced double dealer and you shouldn’t believe him because I promise you, it’s not me, it’s him who wants to put you back into chains. He is planning on selling out everybody to the British who will bring with them re-enslavement. I mean, just a couple of months ago, he expelled the official representative of the French Republic so that he could make deals with the British and the Americans, who are nothing but racists and slavers. So if you think he won’t throw you back into chains, you’re kidding yourself. I am actually the one fighting to keep you free.” ",
            "And the funny thing about all of this is that aside from Rigaud’s very real favoritism of the coloreds, the rival regimes of Toussaint and Rigaud are, like, practically the same. Neither questioned that plantation economics was the only way forward. Neither question that blacks must be the labor force. And despite their mutual accusations, neither planned on re-enslaving the black cultivators. Neither was particularly interested in democratic participation in government, nor being told what to do by France, even as they both positioned themselves as the two representatives of France. And as for cutting deals with the slave powers, I mean, Rigaud has been able to maintain his position thanks to a very brisk trade with American merchants. So what are we really looking at here? That’s right, we are looking at two powerful and ambitious men running into each other. Everything else is just a lot of talk. ",
            "But though they were both ambitious and powerful, there was very little hope for André Rigaud in the final analysis. Because on the eve of the War of Knives, the balance of power in Saint Domingue was hardly a balance of power at all. Between Rigaud’s Legion of the South and various independent forces who would come to back him, he commanded about 15,000 troops. That’s pretty good. But meanwhile, Toussaint now commanded nearly 50,000 troops. Rigaud’s men were better trained and better fighters and better organized, but the brutal math of the thing was overwhelming. Still, though, Rigaud was not content to just sit back and get pushed out of the colony. And so in June 1799, the War of Words ended and the War of Knives began. And Rigaud launched the opening attack of that war. ",
            "This first attack was against a pair of port cities on the north side of the southern peninsula. These two ports were Petit-Goâve and Grand-Goâve. These two ports had been occupied by small garrisons loyal to Toussaint as the British had pulled out in 1798. But in his final dispatch, Hédouville had told Rigaud that those two cities were actually a part of your territory and fall under your jurisdiction. And Rigaud used this to justify mustering a force of 4,000 men to go easily expel Toussaint’s little nominal garrisons. This bold strike also earned him the open support from a great colored officer who currently held the important city of Jacmel and who will go on to figure very prominently in the history of independent Haiti: Alexandre Pétion. ",
            "Pétion was born in Port-au-Prince in 1770 to a big white father and a mulatto mother. So Pétion himself was classified as a quadroon under the now defunct racial categorization system. Like Julien Raimond and André Rigaud and other sons of wealthy mixed race families, Pétion was sent back to France to be educated in 1788. So just before the French Revolution broke out. He’s a hard guy to nail down but Pétion appears to have been back in Saint Domingue by 1791 and as a young, energetic and educated colored man, he enthusiastically joined the colored revolt against racial apartheid when all hell broke loose in the summer of 1791. He then spent the rest of the revolution under arms and remained loyal to the French Republic when other coloreds started bolting for the British after the emancipation decree of 1793. But he was never a part of Rigaud’s Legion of the south and with Toussaint’s elevation to commander in chief, Pétion’s ultimate chain of command led up to Toussaint, not to Rigaud. So his defection to Rigaud in the summer of 1799 was kind of a blow to Toussaint’s plan for a quick and decisive campaign. And just so you know, Alexandre Pétion is going to wind up the first president of the Republic of Haiti. So, yes, he does play a prominent role in the future of independent Haiti. ",
            "Now, Rigaud was hoping that his attack on Petit-Goâve and Grand-Goâve would help trigger a larger anti-Toussaint uprising. And in the early summer of 1799 he had some reason to hope that it might actually happen because up in the heart of Toussaint’s territory, black revolt against Toussaint’s rule began to flare up. In the countryside surrounding Môle-Saint-Nicolas and Port-de-Paix, cultivators rose up in arms against Toussaint’s regime, forcing Toussaint to hold off making an immediate move against Rigaud while he pacified his own territory. I mean, there was even a flash of insurrectionary anger on the North Plains themselves just outside of Le Cap, practically where Toussaint had been born and raised. ",
            "Now, Toussaint Louverture has always cultivated this image of himself as the generous father figure, always forgiving and forgetting, he’s Papa Toussaint. But he had no time or patience for these revolts and so he sent his soldiers into pretty ruthlessly crushed the insurrectionaries and instead of showing mercy, they showed no mercy at all. And the man Toussaint trusted with this is the man whose time has finally come who, like Pétion, will play a huge role in the future of independent Haiti: Jean-Jacques Dessalines.",
            "Jean-Jacques Dessalines was born most likely in Guinea, in West Africa. His birth date is officially listed as September 20, 1758. But to be honest, I have a really hard time believing this was actually officially recorded somewhere. He was captured and sold into slavery as a young boy, likely along with his whole family because we know, for example, that he had two brothers in Saint Domingue with him. He spent his formative years working in the fields of the North Plains but did eventually rise up the ranks to become a driver, which was somewhat unusual for an Africa born slave, but having been brought into slavery at such a young age, I guess he could be trusted. Now, for most of his young life, Dessalines was known as Jean-Jacques Duclos, taking his name from his owner, just as Toussaint was originally known as Toussaint de Bréda because that was his owner’s name. But while the origin of Louverture is a bit confused thanks to many rounds of mythmaking, Dessalines gets his final last name thanks to something far more mundane. Around 1788, he was sold to a new owner named Dessalines and so his name changed. ",
            "When the original slave revolt started brewing in the summer of 1791, Dessalines was right in the heart of it, but he was not one of the leading leaders. When the fighting began, he wound up attached to the army of Jean-François but was not much more than the equivalent of a lieutenant in the slave armies. And though he may have been amongst those who would have been freed, had the big whites accepted that deal at the end of 1791 to end their revolt, he was almost certainly not amongst the final 60 that Toussaint had negotiated down to at the last minute. Dessalines then stayed with Jean-François and was among those formally enrolled into the Spanish army in 1793. At some point, though, in here, he winds up serving under Toussaint Louverture. And when Toussaint took over control of the far west of the North Province, Dessalines went with him and then defected to the French along with Toussaint in the spring of 1794. Under Toussaint’s patronage, Dessalines rose up the ranks quickly as Toussaint identified Dessalines as an officer who could be relied on to get the job done. In the subsequent battles against their old comrades Jean-François and Biassou, Dessalines was given command of important missions and he never let Toussaint down. ",
            "But though Dessalines was for sure an officer Toussaint could count on in the field, there was an even more specific role for Dessalines to play. He was the bad cop, the heavy, the man who had no mercy in his heart whatsoever. And when you’re trying to be enlightened and generous while simultaneously being an authoritarian strong man, as Toussaint currently is trying to do, you need someone who isn’t afraid to do your dirty work for you. And for Toussaint, that man was, among others, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. And this wasn’t just about roleplaying. Though they were tightly linked, Toussaint and Dessalines had genuinely divergent world views. So Toussaint wanted reconciliation and coexistence with the whites and coloreds. He’s not a black supremacist. Well, Dessalines is. He hated the whites and he hated the coloreds. Had Dessalines been an overall command during the War of the Knives, painting it as a race war would have been a no brainer. But he is still just the enforcer, not the supreme leader. And one of the things that a guy like Dessalines allows a guy like Toussaint to do is avoid taking responsibility for brutal but necessary repression, as happened in the North Province in 1799. When the threat of the recent insurrections was eliminated, Toussaint could then come riding in and say “Oh no, this isn’t what I wanted at all. Oh, my friends, this is not what I wanted at all.”",
            "He could curry favor with the black population by openly reprimanding his officers while quietly saying “Thanks, good work.” once the cultivators were back in the fields. ",
            "But open revolt was not the only threat facing Toussaint during the summer of 1799 and he also escaped not one, but two assassination attempts both of which he escaped only by sheer luck. During the first, a gunman opened fire and put a bullet through Toussaint’s hat and one through Toussaint’s personal physician who was killed on the spot. And then during the second multiple gunmen strafed Toussaint’s carriage and riddled it with bullets. But Toussaint just so happened to be riding his horse near the rear of this entourage and was not in the carriage when the assassins struck. Toussaint would pretty much spend the rest of his life not unjustifiably paranoid about assassins and he took elaborate precautions to stymie their efforts. ",
            "Now, as I just mentioned, the brutal math of the War of Knives spelled doom for André Rigaud, especially after whatever anti-Toussaint elements inside the black population were unable to get anything unified going against him. But even with his mass numerical advantage, the truly decisive factor in the War of Knives was the United States Navy. With the signing of Toussaint’s Clause in February 1799, the United States clearly had an interest in continuing to do business with Toussaint Louverture. And the new American consul in Le Cap, a guy named Edward Stevens, was amongst the most vocal proponents of making sure that Toussaint Louverture stayed in power. In the summer of 1799, for example, Toussaint’s army had actually been struggling to properly arm itself after the Quasi War had shut down access to American munitions. Stevens worked with his counterparts in British Jamaica to organize an emergency shipment of arms from the neighboring island to ensure Toussaint was not seriously threatened until bigger caches could be delivered from the mainland. Stevens also wrote home to his superiors in the Adams White House arguing relentlessly that backing Toussaint was in America’s best interest. ",
            "But beyond keeping Toussaint’s supplied, actually supporting him in the war was quite a bit further than anyone in Congress who signed off on Toussaint’s Clause would have been willing to go. But André Rigaud then gave Edward Stevens and the Americans the pretext they were looking for to really enter the fray. Rigaud had a little fleet of pirates operating out of Les Cayes who started to prey on British and American merchants once it became clear that they were supporting Toussaint over Rigaud. With the elimination of piracy being one of the core aims of all the diplomacy between the Adams Administration and Toussaint’s regime, deploying the fledgling U.S. Navy against this new threat posed by Rigaud’s pirates raised no objections. The Americans set up a naval station in Le Cap and then started patrolling the waters around Saint Domingue regularly. And when Rigaud became identified as a pirate enabler, the US Navy showed no hesitation about blockading ports under his control. ",
            "So by the end of 1799, Toussaint was receiving regular shipments of supplies and arms from the United States and their navy was attacking Rigaud. With this support, he then finally launched a full offensive. But before he did, he sent one of his staunchest white supporters, a colonel in the French army named Vincent, back to Paris to explain what he was doing to the Directory and get them to confirm that Toussaint Louverture was in fact the commander in chief of the French Army in Saint Domingue, and that Rigaud not obeying orders was a justifiable cause for the hostilities that were about to commence. Unbeknownst to everyone in Saint Domingue, however, by the end of 1799, the Directory was already dead. ",
            "Without waiting for confirmation from Paris that what he was doing was actually legitimate, Toussaint’s army marched south led by Jean-Jacques Dessalines and this army was too much for Rigaud’s forces to handle. But still, the ensuing battles were hotly contested and very bitter. Neither side offered the other any quarter and when prisoners were taken their usual fate was either execution, or torture and then execution. But against the mass onslaught, Rigaud had to retreat into the mountains of the South Province. And this retreat then became engulfed in flames as Rigaud elected to burn everything to the ground rather than let it fall intact into Toussaint’s hands. Now, Rigaud hoped to raise the black cultivators of the South Province to join him in his fight, but he found almost no takers. The black cultivators of the South Province pretty much hated André Rigaud’s guts and they welcomed the arrival of Toussaint’s army. But sadly, what we’re seeing here and what we’ve already seen earlier in today’s episode is the black cultivators everywhere engaging in a bit of the old ‘grass is greener on the other side’ fallacy. The cultivators under Toussaint hoped Rigaud was their salvation. The cultivators under Rigaud hoped Toussaint was their salvation. But there was no salvation to be had. This was a war between two men running authoritarian labor regimes. This was not a war for anyone’s salvation. ",
            "So Dessalines then peeled off from his pursuit of Rigaud to lay siege to Jacmel where the defenses there were led by Alexandre Pétion. In November 1799, a prolonged siege began that would be as bitter as any battle. It’s reported that somewhere on the order of 4,000 people died of starvation over the next four months as the siege continued. Meanwhile, by early 1800, the United States Navy was now fully on Toussaint’s side. Though Edward Stevens did resist requests from Toussaint to actually transport Toussaint’s troops, the US Navy did blockade all the southern ports and they ran a very close patrol of maritime shipping in Saint Domingue waters. Ships loyal to Toussaint were issued passports by the American consulate that allowed them to operate freely and anyone not holding one of these passports was liable to be boarded and have their ship seized. Now, this made for the rather uncomfortable reality that in Saint Domingue, which was still French, the leaders of Saint Domingue could not operate in their own waters without express written permission from a country that had no legitimate claim to jurisdiction in Saint Domingue waters whatsoever. But Toussaint did not raise any fuss about this since it was all for his benefit. ",
            "In February 1800, Jacmel, now surrounded by Dessalines army on land and the US navy by sea, finally fell. Whatever forces Rigaud had left in the south now fell back to Les Cayes. But there wasn’t much left at all. The story goes that when Rigaud reentered his capital that he rang the tocsin bells to turn out the local blacks to come in from the fields to fight and not a single one came. Now, they had all come to his defense in 1796 because they had been told that the Third Commission was going to re-enslave them, but that had turned out to be a lie. And in the two and a half years since, the lives of the black cultivators had not improved one bit under Rigaud. But still, Rigaud continued to hold out. And from Toussaint’s perspective an all out assault on Les Cayes would have been a very bloody exercise. So rather than rush to a conclusion that seemed inevitable, Toussaint’s forces proceeded slowly and methodically. And rather than give it up Rigaud kept his eye on the horizon hoping, hoping, hoping that reinforcements would arrive from France to help him win the war. But in May 1800 word finally did come from France and it was not what Rigaud wanted to hear at all. ",
            "In the meantime, Toussaint, confident of victory, was already moving on with the next phase of his plan, controlling not just Saint Domingue, but all of Hispaniola. He went to Commissioner Philippe Roume, now under a sort of de facto house arrest and said, “Commissioner, I have grown concerned about reports that honest French citizens are being kidnapped and sold back into slavery over on the Spanish side of the island. This is going on with impunity and it must be stopped. So please sign off on my plan to send French forces to Santo Domingo to ensure that the rights of French citizens are protected. I mean, Santo Domingo is ours, right? Right. So please sign here.” ",
            "Philippe Roume, however, resisted sanctioning Toussaint’s annexation of Santo Domingo without approval from Paris. So to help Roume get over whatever hesitations he might be feeling, Toussaint had his adopted nephew Moyse go round the Northern Plains and raise angry cultivators to march to the very edge of Le Cap and demand that Roume take action to stop their brothers and sisters from being sold back into slavery by the sinister Spanish. And in the face of this mob, Roume capitulated and signed off on Toussaint’s plan. Toussaint then put Roume under an even closer house arrest in the parish of Dondon, where he would no doubt think twice about thinking for himself again. But though he had official permission now to take Santo Domingo, the actual expedition east would wait until after the War of Knives. ",
            "Now, the war was actually brought to a fairly peaceful conclusion. When a commission, yes, another commission arrived from France in May 1800, bearing official proclamations from the new government in Paris. A new government in Paris? Okay. Now, for whatever reason, this latest commission is never anywhere called, like, the Fourth Commission. So I’m not going to introduce new nomenclature that won’t be present in any other history book. And besides, they didn’t really have the same power or authority as previous commissions. They were more like emissaries of First Consul Bonaparte. When they arrived, it became clear that Toussaint’s emissary, Colonel Vincent, had been very persuasive in arguing Toussaint’s case to Bonaparte, seeing as how Vincent himself was one of the three commissioners now getting off the boat. The other two were a random general I won’t bother you with, but the third guy is Julien Raimond. After skipping town with Hédouville in October 1798, Raimond spent less than a year in France before accepting Bonaparte’s request to return to Saint Domingue and represent the Consulate. And I’m sure he was just thrilled to be delivering the news that Bonaparte had taken Vincent’s advice and confirmed Toussaint Louverture as commander in chief of the French army in Saint Domingue. ",
            "This news deflated André Rigaud completely. There would be no French reinforcements to support him. There was really no one anywhere supporting him. And knowing that this was the end for Rigaud, Toussaint then did what Toussaint does best. He issued a general amnesty for anyone who laid down their arms and gave up the fight. He also did not force his defeated rival to bend his knee to him. And he quietly approved Rigaud’s plan to leave the island and sail into exile. In June 1800, Rigaud and his family boarded a ship and sailed for France. But this is not the end of André Rigaud. Once he got to France, he would join a small community of colored Creole and exile. Alexandre Pétion would soon follow, and these guys would continue to lobby for their rights and soon enough, would be headed back to Saint Domingue. But we’ll get into all that next week. ",
            "With Rigaud out of the way, Toussaint personally led his army into Les Cayes. And unless I’m mistaken, I think this is the first time Toussaint has actually ever set foot in the capital city of the South Province. When he arrived, he publicly confirmed the general amnesty. But right on cue, his junior officers carried out a swift massacre of prisoners identified as possible sources of future trouble. Once again, Toussaint expressed horror at the bloodthirsty conduct of his officers and he reprimanded Dessalines, saying, “I asked you to trim the tree, not tear it up by the roots.” But we are talking about hundreds of dead here, not thousands, as later anti-Toussaint rhetoric would have it. And Dessalines himself appears to have personally intervened to save some men slated for execution. ",
            "So Toussaint is triumphant. He is the master of Saint Domingue. But of course, as history has shown us time and time again, final victory often just sets the conditions for the next conflict. And so it was in Saint Domingue in 1800. So just as he defeated his last internal rival, Toussaint suddenly had to start worrying about external threats again. With Bonaparte now in power in France, the whole international arena was undergoing an upheaval. And Saint Domingue had always been merely one piece in a much larger game of chess being played by the Great Powers. Both the Americans and French, for example, were sick of the Quasi War which was hurting them both; negotiations began in March 1800 to end the conflict. And though these negotiations dragged on over sticky issues like whether the Treaty of Friendship of 1778 was still in effect and whether France would pay reparations for the merchandise they had seized from American traders, the matter of Saint Domingue helped keep the two sides at arm’s length. The Americans wanted to guarantee that they would be able to keep trading with the island without interference. And the French negotiator said, “Yeah, we’ll think about it, but we are not very happy with the way you’ve been issuing American passports so that French flagged ships can sail peacefully in French waters. So, I mean, don’t expect a ton of consideration on the Saint Domingue front.” ",
            "But even as the American negotiators were pressing for trade concessions, the actual American merchants coming in and out of Saint Domingue started reporting that this place isn’t nearly as lucrative as it used to be. As we’ve talked about, the years of revolt and war and devastation had left Saint Domingue a shell of its former self and the War of Knives had not improved anything. Toussaint’s attempt to revitalize the plantation system ran into a trifecta of problems, some of which we’ve already mentioned. ",
            "First, there was his own need to keep as many young men under arms as possible. Second, the material devastation of the formerly industrialized sugar plantations was starting to look permanent. And third, the unwillingness of the cultivators to work themselves to death to maximize sugar and coffee exports. ",
            "So both British and American merchants sailing regularly into Saint Domingue Harbor since the signing of Toussaint’s Clause the year before, were very disappointed by what they found. Saint Domingue was not producing enough exports to make the trips worthwhile. The merchandise the British and Americans carried into Le Cap went unsold and the mountains of coffee and sugar they were supposed to be picking up did not materialize. The opening of Saint Domingue was supposed to be a boon to the merchant fortunes. And instead, it was a deflated bust. Suddenly, the northeastern merchants weren’t quite so hot to demand American foreign policy make special concessions for Saint Domingue. And with the war with France winding down and Thomas Jefferson and his Democratic republicans ready to storm the government in the election of 1800, the whole relationship between the United States and Saint Domingue, which had been so critical to Toussaint’s final victory, was about to be reappraised entirely. ",
            "And then, back in France, First Consul Bonaparte is obviously not the kind of guy who is going to let a key piece of the French Empire operate without proper oversight. Of course, at the moment, Bonaparte had European wars and politics to contend with, so colonial affairs were not his top priority. But in the Constitution of Year VIII, that created the consulate, he wrote in an article that addressed colonial policy that spelled big trouble for Toussaint Louverture, because Bonaparte was about to take French policy round back to where it had been before Thermidor. No more of this French nation ‘one and indivisible’ nonsense. The article in question, Article 91, is short, and so I’ll quote it in full: “The form of government of the French colonies is determined by special laws.” And that’s it. But in Saint Domingue, special laws had always meant one thing: apartheid and slavery. So when Bonaparte sent his emissaries to Saint Domingue, they carried with them both the Constitution of Year VIII and a letter written by Bonaparte to placate colonial fears that those special laws would mean a return of slavery and apartheid. And though it’s a little longer than Article 91, I’m also going to quote it in full because it’s an interesting little document and clearly written with Montesquieu open in Bonaparte’s lap. ",
            "“Citizens, a constitution that wasn’t able to defend itself against multiple violations has been replaced by a new pact destined to solidify freedom. Article 91 states that the French colonies will be ruled by special laws. This disposition derives from the nature of things and the differences in climate. The inhabitants of French colonies located in America, Asia and Africa cannot be governed by the same laws. The difference in habits, in morals and interests, the diversity of soil, crops and goods produced demand diverse modifications. Far from being a subject of alarm for you, you will recognize here the wisdom and profundity of vision that animate the legislators of France. The consuls of the Republican announcing to you the new social pact declare to you that the sacred principles of freedom and equality of the blacks will never suffer amongst you the least attack or modification. If there are ill intentioned men in the colony, if there are those who still have relations with enemy powers, remember, brave blacks, that the French people alone recognize your freedom and the equality of your rights. Signed, First Consul Bonaparte.”  ",
            "Now, this was a wild pack of bullshit. Bonaparte was too busy with more pressing affairs to get going on his expanding dream of true global domination. But when he said, “The blacks had nothing to worry about.” – Man, they had everything to worry about. Because when Bonaparte finally got free of European war, he turned the full force of his attention to completely and thoroughly reimposing French authority in Saint Domingue, reinstituting white supremacy, and re enslaving the blacks. ",
            "But before Bonaparte could draft the kind of special laws that would tend to do well, all of this, Toussaint would beat him to the punch. And next week, without the permission or even consultation with the French government, Toussaint Louverture will draft the Constitution of 1801, which he will then unilaterally assert fulfills Article 91 of the Constitution of Year VIII. You said we are to be governed by special laws? Well, great. I’ve got your special laws right here, and I dare you to do anything about them.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "As the summer of 1800 drew to a close, Toussaint Louverture was at the pinnacle of his career. The dream he had been working towards since at least 1793 and very possibly since 1791, had finally come to pass. He had outmaneuvered all his native rivals, expelled any uppity French commissioners, and outlasted every foreign enemy. He was now the master of Saint Domingue, and soon enough, he would be the master of all of Hispaniola. With this unrivaled power, he began to forge what has become known to history as the Louverturian State, which was the full embrace of that third option for the future of Saint Domingue that we talked about back in Episode 4.9: the three races coexisting in an export based plantation economy, and that coexistence would now be enforced by Toussaint’s huge standing army.",
            "But the problem for Toussaint was that by any objective measure, this option was a crappy one for the black cultivators who formed the mass of the population. Yes, they now earn some money for their work, and they weren’t literally being worked to death. But in the main, their daily lives were no different than they had been before the revolution. The changes that had been brought about were often frustratingly superficial. Like, for example, use of the whip, that most hated symbol of slavery, was now banned, and foreman used clubs instead. So at his moment of triumph, Toussaint Louverture began to lose the support of the black population. ",
            "Cultivator dissatisfaction with Toussaint quickly deepened when he promulgated a new set of labor rules in October 1800 that promised the workers little in the way of actual freedom. In fact, what he was essentially doing is drafting them all as the civilian workforce to his highly militarized Louverturian state. Toussaint denounced those who refused to work while hiding behind what he called the pretext of freedom. He said of the cultivators, “They change their place of labor as they please, go to and fro, and pay not the least attention to agriculture, though the only means of furnishing subsistence to the military, their protectors.” And so he decreed that whereas a soldier cannot leave his company, his battalion or half brigade, and enter into another without the severest punishment unless provided with a permission, field negroes are forbidden to quit their prospective plantations without lawful permission. And you can imagine how often that permission was going to be granted.",
            "The first article of the Labor Code then said further: “All overseers, drivers and field negroes are bound to observe with exactness, submission and obedience their duty in the same manner as soldiers.” As we’ve seen, for Toussaint, emancipation had never meant the freedom to just do whatever you wanted and he was now explicitly bringing military style discipline to the plantations. After ticking off a few more rules, the Code concluded by saying, “All those who shall be found in contravention here, too, shall be instantly arrested. Liberty cannot exist without industry.” And this is all moving into pretty Orwellian territory. Not that freedom is slavery, but that slavery is freedom. ",
            "Now, this is just one of many Labor Codes we’ve seen promulgated since the Emancipation Decree of August 1793. And as I’ve mentioned a few times, the gap between what these codes required and what the cultivators were actually willing to do could in fact be quite wide. On many plantations throughout Saint Domingue, the labor laws had always been nodded at, but if the bulk of your workforce said, “We’re actually going to go do our own thing today. There is very little you could actually do about it.” But now that the British were gone and the War of Knives had been concluded, Toussaint now had a mechanism of enforcement and that was the army, which, as you were about to see, is fast becoming the central focus of his regime. The army would be both the ends and the means of the Louverturian state. ",
            "Now, making the military the central focus was not unreasonable. Political, legal and administrative institutions in Saint Domingue had never been particularly robust. Remember, before the revolution, the whole of the royal government was maybe 500 guys, and the years of war, revolt and destruction hadn’t exactly been fertile soil to grow a stable civilian administrative apparatus. But what had grown up was a stable military apparatus and since that apparatus was under Toussaint’s direct control he decided to transfer its principal duty from defeating the British, who were now gone, to helping him govern Saint Domingue. ",
            "So while he did demobilize some of his forces after the War of Knives, Toussaint maintained a robust standing army that simultaneously served multiple purposes. First, there was always the possibility that some foreign threat might suddenly loom on the horizon. I mean, who knows? Maybe the French will make a play to retake the island. Second, cultivator revolts had flared up repeatedly over the years and so keeping the army intact in short order would be quickly restored. And then third, it could serve as the administrative apparatus of his state. The officers acting as supervisors, the men acting as enforcers. ",
            "Toussaint divided the colony into administrative zones that were coexistive with military jurisdictions and then doled out civilian job titles to his senior officers. So, for example, his adopted nephew Moyse was both the commander in chief of the military forces of the North Province and its agricultural inspector which meant enforcing the Labor Codes. Now, as we’ll see at the end of today’s episode, Moyse was not nearly as interested in being Toussaint’s strong arm as, say Dessalines who was given a similar set of titles in the south. But regular soldiers generally took a perverse pleasure in keeping the cultivators in line. Life as a common soldier may have been slightly better than life as a cultivator but not by much. And Toussaint clearly fostered a culture that let the soldiers take their frustrations out on the cultivators who they despised as too weak to be anything but cultivators. Senior officers, meanwhile, were granted a cut of the profits from plantations under their jurisdiction to motivate enforcement of the Labor Codes. ",
            "And so the split between the civilians and soldiers grew wider as each came to hate the other. While he was entrenching this new military regime, Toussaint also moved to make sure it covered all of Hispaniola. He had induced Commissioner Roume to sign off on the annexation of Spanish Santo Domingo back in May but had prudently waited for the conclusion of the War of Knives to proceed. In December 1800 though, Toussaint organized an expedition and put it under the command of Moyse. Moyse then marched east at the head of either 10,000 or 20,000 men (I’ve seen both numbers reported) and he took Santo Domingo after only token resistance by the small Spanish garrison still on the island. Now, I’ve actually read a lot of conflicting information about the process of this annexation, that Moyse’s army was greeted as liberators and that they were despised as foreign invaders. I’ve seen it reported both that the 25,000 or so slaves in Spanish territory were immediately freed and also that this never actually happened. But given that the coming Constitution of 1801 would apply to the whole island and would be unequivocal about emancipation, I do have a hard time believing that the Spanish slaves were not freed, though how different they found their actual condition, given the Orwellian nature of Louverturian freedom, is a different matter entirely. ",
            "Now whichever set of facts happens to be true, I am confident about two things. First, Toussaint did, in fact, annex Santo Domingo in January 1801. And second, when First Consul Bonaparte found out what Toussaint had done, he was furious. Now, last we checked in with Bonaparte it was early 1800 and he had just been convinced by Toussaint’s white advocate, Colonel Vincent that Toussaint should keep his position as commander in chief of the French army in Saint Domingue. But thanks to the pressing realities of war and politics in Europe, Bonaparte had not been able to pay much more attention to colonial affairs. In early 1800, France was still at war with Britain and back at war with Austria. So when Bonaparte signed the confirmation of Toussaint’s command, the First Consul himself was mostly focused on the crucial campaign he was about to wage against the Austrians. But that was then, it is now, one year later, Bonaparte has whipped the Austrians and in February 1801 the two sides completed the Treaty of Luneville, which once again brought the land war in Europe to a close. And this was not at all coincidentally, the moment that London sent peace feelers to Paris. War weariness had finally settled in everywhere and the government of Britain started laying the groundwork for peaceful coexistence with Bonaparte’s France. Freed of the war with Austria and with the British now looking to lay down their arms too, the First Consul could turn his attention once and for all to colonial matters. ",
            "The development of Bonaparte’s colonial policy is hard to trace in a straight line and he went back and forth in his head about how he wanted to proceed. And there were an array of interested parties trying to push him in their preferred direction. There were, for example, unreconstructed big whites who took the arrival of the more conservative Consulate to mean that they could poke their heads back up again. Among them were Moreau de Saint-Méry, back from his exile in Philadelphia and with his well known expertise was given a position in the Consulate’s colonial office. These old big whites demanded a return to white supremacy and slavery and also the return of any property that they had lost over the past decade including human property. Obviously they argued that the ex-slave Toussaint Louverture could not be kept in power. So these guys were anti-emancipation, pro-racist and anti-Toussaint Louverture. ",
            "But balancing this group were more liberal whites who also had long experience in the colony who told Bonaparte that emancipation and racial equality could not be undone, but that Toussaint Louverture was a dangerous tyrant who could not be maintained in power. This was, for example, the line taken by Sonthonax who took time out of his retirement to draft a memorandum defending liberty and equality while denouncing Toussaint. Joining this particular line were the exiled free coloreds like André Rigaud and General Villatte and Alexandre Pétion. It would be the height of folly to re-enslave the blacks, but you must get rid of Toussaint. So this group was pro-emancipation, anti-racist, but also anti-Toussaint. ",
            "But Toussaint did have his supporters. Presumably Lavaux continued to stump for his old friend and comrade. And then amongst those arguing in Toussaint’s favor, may have been Joséphine Bonaparte. Napoleon’s wife was a Creole born into a wealthy planter family from Martinique who owned a plantation in Saint Domingue. After winning the War of Knives, Toussaint had taken over this plantation and now ran it at the state’s expense, sending the profits back to Joséphine. Now, traditionally, Joséphine has been cast as the mouthpiece of the unreconstructed big whites whispering in Napoleon’s ear to reimpose slavery and white supremacy. But her and Toussaint apparently exchanged mutually grateful letters and there’s no actual evidence that Joséphine was pushing this racist slave line. And I’m following here the excellent recent book by Philippe Girard called “The Slaves Who Defeated Napoleon”. It spends quite a bit of time analyzing Bonaparte’s decision making during this period. ",
            "By early 1801 though, it’s clear that Bonaparte had at least decided that the de facto independence that had reigned in Saint Domingue since 1791 was going to end. If he really was able to get clear of the British, he was going to send an army to the Caribbean to fully reassert French control over her colonies. But where Toussaint fit into this equation still appeared to be up in the air as late as March 1801. On the one hand, a talented military strongman like Toussaint might be of great service – keeping Saint Domingue in line, strengthening French power in the Americas. Then again, Toussaint might be a huge hindrance. He might go fight for independence and weaken French power in the Americas. Bonaparte’s indecision went so far as to produce a letter in early March 1801, never actually sent, confirming Toussaint’s rank as Commander in Chief. But by the end of the month, Bonaparte had changed his mind. The First Consul decided that General Toussaint was likely to be more of a hindrance than a help in implementing his master plan, a master plan we’ll get to in a moment, and so he drafted orders to relieve Toussaint of his command. These orders would be carried by the massive military expedition Bonaparte began to organize to reassert the Metropole’s authority over her wayward colony. ",
            "Now, oddly enough though, it was not until about a week after he drafted this order that the absolutely enraging news came in from Toussaint saying, “Oh, by the way, I just annexed Santo Domingo. Just thought you should know.” This news was infuriating to Bonaparte on multiple levels. On a political level, Bonaparte did not want Toussaint to control the whole island. On a military level, this closed off any chances that the coming expedition would enjoy an uncontested landing on the east end of Hispaniola. And then, on a personal level, Toussaint had not asked for permission to annex Santo Domingo, he had just done it and only reported it after the fact. And this was a direct challenge to the First Consul’s authority and it made Bonaparte’s blood boil. ",
            "But here we get to talk about the delicious irony of the relationship between Bonaparte and Toussaint. We went through Bonaparte’s early career in pretty good detail during the French Revolution episodes. And can you guys remember a single time that Bonaparte asked permission to do anything? I mean, he marched around conquering territory, creating new republics from thin air, writing constitutions, opening diplomatic negotiations with foreign powers, all by fiat and assertion, and always reported back to Paris after the fact. And now here he is, faced with a subordinate general, because that’s what Toussaint still is, remember, he’s just a general in the French Army, doing exactly, and I mean exactly what Bonaparte had once done. And Bonaparte hates him for it. Toussaint is sometimes called the black Napoleon. And as you can see, then, the analogy was not just that they were two great autocratic minded military men who served in the French army around the same time. Toussaint is running Bonaparte’s playbook here. He’s conducting his own foreign policy, annexing territory without orders, and he’s about to draft a constitution. When confronted with a general who was the mirror image of himself, First Consul Bonaparte is absolutely losing his mind. And the irony really is delicious. ",
            "Unbeknownst to Bonaparte, Toussaint was continuing to run the Bonaparte playbook by drafting a constitution for Saint Domingue. On February 4, 1801, the 7th anniversary of the National Convention sweeping confirmation of emancipation and racial equality, Toussaint convened a small committee to draft a constitution. The composition of this committee was reflective of Toussaint’s slow drift away from his roots. No longer did he identify with the black workers in the field and instead he surrounded himself with the educated whites of the salons. The men he called were seven whites and two coloreds. One of them, probably the most important of them, was Julien Raimond. These guys worked into the summer of 1801, drawing up a constitution that would replace Toussaint’s de facto military dictatorship with a du jour military dictatorship. ",
            "And this is as good a time as any to mention that his work on the Constitution of 1801 would be Julien Raimond’s last public act. Shortly after the constitution was published, Raimond died at the age of 57. He was, without question, one of the two or three most important figures in the history of the Haitian Revolution, serving on both sides of the Atlantic, pushing for the equal rights of all men before the Declaration of the Rights of Man had even been conceived. And though Raimond had been a slaveholder and had never fought for emancipation, when it came, he defended it too. That all men were born and remained free and equal in rights. The constitution he was now helping draft for his colony had to have been bittersweet. It would confirm absolutely the racial equality he had sought his whole life. But it also created an authoritarian dictatorship that could not have been 100% in line with his own political principles. ",
            "But though Toussaint Louverture was now transitioning into absolute military dictator, he was not the kind of guy to just kick back in a fortress and live fat while his country went to hell. Toussaint had a restless, almost manic energy and with so few actual political institutions able to govern the colony, it fell to him to manage and even micromanage everything. He and his secretaries had gotten their dictation system down to a refined art and everyday Toussaint composed 100 or more letters and decrees and memos. He practically never slept in the same bed on consecutive nights, and he and his small cadre of secretaries kept constantly on the move, riding 100 miles a day, no problem. Now, part of this was to stymie assassination attempts and he made a regular habit of saying he was going to one place and then suddenly turning around and riding in the opposite direction. He also, for the record, avoided open windows and only ate food prepared by his personal cooks. But this was also about the need to be everywhere at once. ",
            "So Toussaint was a dictator and his vision for Saint Domingue was increasingly resented by the population. But I don’t think that his embrace of harsh authoritarian plantation economics was just a cynical power play. I mean, it was, but I think he really did believe that it was the best thing for the colony and he worked tirelessly to make it work for the colony. He was a man of action and energy and he never stopped moving until the day that he was finally thrown into a dismal prison and left to die. And even then, I can’t imagine that Toussaint Louverture ever stopped thinking and planning and dreaming. ",
            "So the constitution that emerged in the summer of 1801, known to history as the Constitution of 1801, was a blueprint, as I’ve said, for a military dictatorship but not an independent military dictatorship. And the very first article said that Saint Domingue was a part of the French empire and that this document merely fulfilled Article 91 of the Constitution of Year VIII which required special laws for the colonies. Clearly though, the Constitution of 1801 was meant to preempt any attempt by France to use special laws to reverse all that had been achieved since 1791. So Toussaint’s constitution stated, there can exist no slaves in this territory where servitude is forever abolished and all men are born, live and die free and French. And then it went on to say every man, whatever his color, has access to all types of employment. But after enshrining these most radical of revolutionary doctrines, liberty and equality. The rest of the Constitution of 1801 was authoritarian and conservative. It said, for example, that as the colony is based on agriculture, it cannot permit the slightest interruption in agricultural work, and then proceeded to explicitly enshrine the Labor Code Toussaint had promulgated in October. ",
            "As for the nature of the government itself, it said, “The Constitution designates as Governor citizen Toussaint Louverture, General in Chief of the army of Saint Domingue. In consideration of the important services this General has rendered to the colony in critical circumstances of the revolution and in accordance with the wishes of the grateful inhabitants, the reigns are bestowed upon him for the rest of his glorious life.” ",
            "The powers that the Governor would now enjoy for the rest of his glorious life were both wide and deep. He could hire and fire every military or government officer. He proposed and enforced all laws. A small assembly called the Central Assembly was created, but all it could do was approve or reject laws proposed by the Governor. And since the assembly was elected by local administrators appointed by the Governor, well, you can imagine how often they could be expected to resist his will. And in case there was any mistaking that the military was the source of political power, if the Governor died in office, his power would, quote, “pass provisionally into the hands of the highest ranking general”. You can’t really be more clear than that. And if you didn’t like any of this, well, that was tough luck. The Governor had the right to censor the press at his discretion, political clubs were forbidden, and the courts, like everything else, were under the Governor’s direct authority. And if he suspected you of sedition, you wouldn’t even go to the regular court. You would face a special military tribunal, also directly controlled by, you guessed it, the Governor. ",
            "When the Constitution emerged in June 1801, Toussaint showed it to his friend and supporter, Colonel Vincent, who said, “Yeah, okay, this is fine, but for God’s sake, don’t publish it without approval from France. Whatever that first article says about being a part of the French Empire, if you unilaterally adopt this constitution, it will be taken as a declaration of independence, and France will have to respond.” But Toussaint decided to push on anyway. As long as France and Britain were at war and the British Navy controlled the Atlantic, he had nothing substantial to worry about from France. First Consul Bonaparte could stomp his feet all he wanted, but it would not create a ripple in the ocean that stood between them. So on July 8, 1801, Toussaint convened a massive public ceremony in Le Cap and announced that the new Constitution was in effect and he was officially Governor for life. ",
            "With the Constitution then published, he gave Colonel Vincent the unenviable task of carrying it back to Paris to present it to First Consul Bonaparte. So back to Europe when Colonel Vincent, who appears to have spent most of his time between 1799 and 1801 on a boat somewhere in the Atlantic. But Colonel Vincent need not have worried about Toussaint Louverture provoking the First Consul, because by the time the Constitution was published, Bonaparte was already way ahead of them. ",
            "Having settled on a course of confrontation with Saint Domingue, First Consul Bonaparte had been steadily building up his invasion force. It had begun in May as a contingent of a few thousand troops, but had been ballooning by the week as the First Consul kept adding more brigades to the expedition, most of them coming from the veteran divisions of the army of the Rhine. But it was all going to be for naught if he couldn’t properly manage France’s international relationships. And to help him manage those relationships, he turned, of course, to his foreign Minister, Talleyrand. ",
            "Bonaparte and Talleyrand were already well on their way to diplomatic victory by the summer of 1801. And it was really just the last few details that needed to be locked down with the three powers they needed to maneuver around: the United States, Spain and Britain. To take the United States first, as we discussed in Episode 3.44, “The War Feeds Itself”, the French war machine was now premised on supplying and enriching itself from the territories they conquered and occupied. But this approach was not going to work in Saint Domingue. Everyone knew the colony was built on cash crops, the inhabitants couldn’t feed or supply themselves. So it’s not like a massive French army is going to be able to just live off the land. And since supply lines across the Atlantic were long and fraught with danger and delay, ensuring that the French army could buy from American suppliers was critical to the success of the mission. ",
            "So first, Bonaparte had to bring the Quasi War to an end. The negotiations that had begun in March 1800 to end the conflict finally concluded in September with the signing of the Convention of 1800. This convention returned the two countries to a state of peace, ending both their military and trade war, and I should add, making a dead letter of Toussaint’s Clause. This was good news for the French Consulate. And then, a few months later, they got even better news: Thomas Jefferson and his partisans had just captured both the White House and Congress. Since Jefferson was a Francophile slave owner, one might expect that his position towards the slave state of Saint Domingue would be quite a bit different than the Adams Administration. And indeed it was, which was music to the ears of Bonaparte and Talleyrand, and not so much for Toussaint Louverture. ",
            "Talleyrand then personally selected an agent to go field Jefferson out. In their first meeting, Jefferson seemed to indicate that aiding the French expedition would be no problem at all. He referred to Saint Domingue as another Algiers, that as a pirate state that was a threat to all civilized nations. He said that the Americans would be happy to keep French bellies full while starving out Toussaint Louverture. The agent reported all this back to Paris with enthusiastic delight, and Talleyrand and Bonaparte received it with enthusiastic delight. But unfortunately, Thomas Jefferson was a man who often said one thing and did another, as the French would soon find out.",
            "Aside from the Americans, there was also the Spanish, who held in their possession something that Bonaparte wanted very badly. So just after concluding the treaty with the Americans that ended the Quasi War, the French concluded a secret treaty with the Spanish in October 1800 that fulfilled one of Bonaparte’s key ambitions: the reacquisition of the Louisiana territory. The Louisiana territory had, of course, originally been a French possession, part of their massive land claims in North America that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. But when the French had gotten beat in the Seven Years War, they ceded Canada to the British and Louisiana to the Spanish, and the Spanish had been holding it ever since. Louisiana territory was huge, as you hopefully remember from fifth grade history. It encompassed the whole western half of the Mississippi River watershed. And as we discussed way back in Episode 2.14, “The Critical Period”, relations between the Spanish and the new United States over access to the Mississippi River was a major point of contention for the early American governments. Under heavy pressure from Bonaparte, the Spanish agreed to retro seed Louisiana to the French in exchange for some territory in Italy. ",
            "The reacquisition of Louisiana was as critical to Bonaparte’s long term ambitions in the Americas, as securing supplies from the United States was to his short term ambitions. And for the same reasons: Saint Domingue and Guadeloupe and Martinique and any other Caribbean island the French may happen to one day control were best exploited as sugar and coffee factories. Directing them towards any other end was just silly. But as we saw back at the beginning of our series on the Haitian Revolution, actually supplying the sugar islands from France was arduous, expensive and not particularly efficient. It was a system that was often unable to supply everything the colonies actually needed, which was one of those lines of tension we talked about in our original web of tension. So what Bonaparte now had in mind was that the sugar islands would draw their resources from mainland French Louisiana in a traditional mercantilist, closed market colonial system with all the profits shipped back to France. But even more than that, Bonaparte envisioned that one day the entire Gulf of Mexico would be the exclusive domain of the French Empire. But when the details of the secret handover of Louisiana started leaking out to the capitals of the world, President Thomas Jefferson would start to really wonder who posed a bigger threat to America’s interests in the Caribbean: Toussaint Louverture or Napoleon Bonaparte?",
            "With the Spanish and Americans taken care of, Bonaparte and Talleyrand then turned back to the real key: the British. If the British decided to stand in the way of Bonaparte’s plan to retake Saint Domingue… Well, I mean, the British Navy is awesome. You can’t have the British standing in your way. Luckily, Westminster was sick of war. And so in October 1801, that is a year after the treaties had been signed with the Americans and Spanish, the British and French signed the preliminary articles of what would become the Treaty of Amiens. But just because peace was at hand, that didn’t mean the French could expect the British to just sit back and watch a massive French armada sail across the Atlantic. So Bonaparte worked to get a firm commitment from the British that the massing French fleet would not be messed with. But the British were noncommittal. They agreed in principle that France had the right to access her colonies without interference and also that an armed slave state in the Caribbean was in no one’s interest. But, well, what if you’re lying? What if this is all a ruse and that at the last minute, the French armada sails right on by Saint Domingue and instead launches an invasion of Jamaica? This was not irrational paranoia. This was a very plausible threat. So the British dragged their feet on giving Bonaparte an answer. ",
            "The foot dragging was especially frustrating for Bonaparte because one thing everyone now understood about sending European troops to the Caribbean was that these troops were going to be decimated by malaria and yellow fever their first summer in the colonies. So the expedition to Saint Domingue had to get to Saint Domingue and secure control of Saint Domingue before the summer of 1802, otherwise the whole thing would be a write off. So Bonaparte was really desperate to get the British admiralty to say, “Okay, we won’t mess with you.” And he did two things to get them to say this. One pretty obvious, the other pretty unconventional.",
            "The obvious one was to say, “Look, if my guys don’t leave soon, I’m going to have to cancel the whole expedition. If I do that, I’ll just go ahead and confirm General Toussaint and you guys can deal with a quasi independent slave state, armed to the teeth, 50 miles from Jamaica.” ",
            "Now, the unconventional thing he did was to hand over a complete inventory of everything being made ready to sail. Every ship, every regiment, every gun, every barrel of flour. He handed over the expedition’s entire manifest and said, “I would not be giving you this if my plan was to attack you, now, would I? So can I please go reconquer my colony now?” And the British said, “Okay”, and then they held their breath. ",
            "If there was any lingering doubt in Bonaparte’s mind that pushing Toussaint out of power was the right thing to do, these were banished when Colonel Vincent showed up at the end of October with a copy of the Constitution of 1801 in hand. Vincent tried to defend what Toussaint had done, but Bonaparte took it exactly the way that Colonel Vincent expected that he would: as a declaration of independence. After a curt face-to-face meeting, Bonaparte dismissed Vincent, and Vincent would not return to Saint Domingue. Governor for life Toussaint Louverture was on his own. And with the international waters cleared and the army massed on the Atlantic coast, it was time for the French invasion fleet to set sail. ",
            "We’ll get into all the details of what will become known as the Leclerc Expedition next week. But to end this week’s show, we must return to Saint Domingue, because just as the Constitution of 1801 was landing on Bonaparte’s desk, Toussaint had to deal with his most troubling cultivator insurrection, both in terms of its size and its personal implications. ",
            "On October 21, 1801, ominous movements in Le Cap raised alarm bells inside the headquarters of the general in charge of the city, a guy by the name of Henri Christophe, who just so happens to be the future Emperor of the Kingdom of Haiti. But let’s set that aside for now. Christophe was alerted to suspicious meetings of blacks in Le Cap, and when he rode out to investigate, he actually got shot at by a would-be assassin. The assassin was captured and then persuaded to spill his guts that a widespread network of conspirators was planning an armed revolt, one that looked to rival the original slave rebellion of 1791. But Christophe had caught on just in the nick of time. With a list of names in hand, he then spent the rest of the night rounding up everyone believed to be connected to the plot. And by the time the sun rose, the revolt had been crushed before it had a chance to begin. ",
            "But that was just the revolt set to go off in the city, because out on the Northern Plains, where Boukman and Jeannot and Jean-François and Biassou had raised the initial revolt ten years earlier, the cultivators were rising up again. By October 23, great mobs of armed blacks were marching through the Plains, killing every wight they could find. Hundreds of whites were massacred over the next few days. This sudden and very well coordinated uprising pointed to professional planning, and suspicion fell on General Moyse, the commander in chief of the North Province. Moyse had been growing visibly disenchanted with Toussaint’s regime, and he was making no secret about it. Moyse had resisted harsh implementation of the Labor Codes, and he told his adoptive uncle, quote, “I will not be the executioner of my race.” He also advocated breaking off small plots of land and selling them to junior officers and even common soldiers to move the colony away from huge plantations towards smaller self-sufficiency. Moyse’s involvement in the revolt was further suspected because the uprising was launched just as Toussaint was beginning a three week inspection tour of the south, the first stop of which would be attending Dessalines’s wedding in Saint-Marc. And you had to be somebody who knew that the governor and his most ruthless general were going to be distracted to coordinate that kind of timing. ",
            "Now, whatever Moyse’s actual role, the insurrection turned out to be short lived. Christophe had managed to nip the urban side of the revolt in the bud and then hold the line on the Plains until reinforcements arrived. And when reinforcements did arrive, they arrived in force and led by Dessalines, the cultivators were ruthlessly crushed and the leaders either killed in battle or arrested and dragged to Le Cap for summary trial. Moyse was himself arrested and held in custody until Toussaint arrived in Le Cap on November 4. All the captured leaders fell under the special military tribunals that would prosecute sedition. But Toussaint would not even allow these to proceed. He ordered his officers to find Moyse and the alleged conspirators guilty without even letting them speak in their own defense. Indeed, the next time Moyse did speak in public, it was standing before a firing squad, and Toussaint allowed his adopted nephew the courtesy to give the order to fire. ",
            "After summarily executing two or three dozen ringleaders, Toussaint then published a scathing address denouncing the ungrateful and dishonorable black cultivators who lacked religion and morals. Throughout the address, he really starts to sound like no one so much as a Robespierre at the end of his rope. He denounced the population for their lack of virtue. And he followed this address by tightening the labor laws still further, creating a system of identification cards that everyone was required to carry at all times. It listed your name and occupation and place of residence. And if you weren’t where you were supposed to be, doing what you were supposed to be doing, the consequences would be severe, because slavery is freedom. ",
            "The aborted revolt and Toussaint’s reaction to it exposed deep cleavages in Saint Domingue. The cultivators hated the military. The military hated the cultivators. Toussaint was no longer an object of venerated affection. His senior officers had just watched Toussaint execute his own adopted nephew without trial for merely being suspected of sedition. And they had to wonder if that would one day be their fate, too. So this was a really bad time to be getting news that France and Britain had concluded a peace. News of their treaty finally hit Saint Domingue in December 1801. And with it came news that Bonaparte was massing a fleet. So next week, Toussaint Louverture would face a war the size and scope of which was larger than anything he had faced so far. And it was a war that his people would eventually win, but that Toussaint himself would ultimately lose.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "For all the attention First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte had taken to arrange the massive expedition he hoped would soon recapture Saint Domingue, when the Peace Preliminaries were signed with the British in October 1801, he had yet to settle on a commander in chief for the campaign, but by the end of the month, he finally tapped a young general named Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc. All of 29 years old, Leclerc was an intimate member of Bonaparte’s inner circle. The two had begun serving together as young officers at the siege of Toulon. And during the Italian campaigns, Bonaparte elevated Leclerc to the rank of General of Division. Leclerc was the man Bonaparte dispatched back to Paris to tell the Directory that he had just signed the Leoben Peace Preliminaries in the spring of 1797, you know, after he had signed them. ",
            "The two men were so close that when Bonaparte accidentally stumbled upon his sister Pauline in amorous consultation, he was delighted rather than outraged that Leclerc was the man with whom Pauline was consulting. In fact, just as Bonaparte was settling on Leclerc as the man to lead the Saint Domingue expedition, he also decided that Leclerc was the right man to make Pauline an honest woman. So Leclerc got both his military orders and a demand that he marry Pauline at practically the same time. In part, this was because Pauline had a habit for scandal and Bonaparte wanted to marry her off. But it also represents a further step in Bonaparte’s long term plans to forge an imperial family to help him rule the world. So Leclerc got his orders, got married, and then departed Paris to join his new fleet. ",
            "And what a fleet it was. The Saint Domingue Expedition, known historically as the Leclerc Expedition for obvious reasons, now comprised 50 ships spread out across seven Atlantic ports. Among those 50 were fully half the French navy’s heavy warships. This fleet was manned by 20,000 sailors prepared to ferry 20,000 soldiers across the Atlantic, all of them crack units and veterans of the Revolutionary Wars. And unlike previous military missions to the colonies, an array of talented and ambitious officers eagerly signed up for the mission. As we’ve seen, these kind of talented and ambitious officers have been pretty adept at not getting themselves sent to the colonies. But now that peace was at hand in Europe, Saint Domingue was the only place left to go hunting for riches and glory. Every officer no doubt planned to use this opportunity to acquire a plantation or two for himself that would keep him in fine style for the rest of his life. The dream of hitting the colonial jackpot was alive and well. ",
            "Also joining this expedition were a number of men that we’ve already met. Leclerc’s second in command, for example, was General Rochambeau, now embarking on his third tour of duty in the colony. Also aboard were most of the colored exiles, André Rigaud, chief among them, but also General Villatte, rehabilitated from his aborted coup back in 1796, Alexandre Pétion, who will remember becoming the first president of the Republic of Haiti. And then Pétion’s 26 year old protege, Jean-Pierre Boyer, who will become the second president of the Republic of Haiti. We also find on board Jean-Baptiste Belley, the one time free black militia colonel who had helped save the Second Commissioners during the Battle of Le Cap, been appointed to the Tricolor Commission, and then been elected to serve as a delegate in both the National Convention and the Council of Five Hundred. Finally, among the Creoles taking part were Toussaint’s two sons, who had both been getting their education in France and then serving as de facto hostages for the past five years. They were ordered by Bonaparte to take part in the expedition, specifically to convince their father to stand down. ",
            "But though he had organized a massive armada to go retake Saint Domingue, Bonaparte was mostly interested in using their overwhelming force to forestall a war rather than wage one. And he gave Leclerc a highly confidential three step program to retake Saint Domingue, hopefully without firing a shot. So, step one: When you arrive, offer assurances to both General Toussaint personally and the population generally that your intentions are peaceful and just. Promise Toussaint literally anything to get him to hand over the keys to the principal ports and military fortresses. Promise him anything. It doesn’t matter, because you’re not going to keep any of those promises. ",
            "Once you have control of all the strategic bases, move on to step two: Demand that Toussaint cede both his civilian and military authority. Again, promise him anything to get this done. But more importantly, make it 100% clear that all the other black officers would keep their rank, privilege and position. The point here is to isolate Toussaint by making sure his senior officers knew that their positions would not be threatened by the overthrow of Toussaint. Again, make any promises necessary. Once you’ve secured the goodwill of these officers, use them to pacify any native uprisings that may have sprung up since your arrival. So once you’ve won over the officers, neutralized Toussaint and pacified the colony. Then move on to step three: Arrest every single Creole officer above the rank of captain and deport them from the island in one fell swoop. Anyone who resists with armed force should be summarily shot. ",
            "Bonaparte estimated this three step plan would take about three months, start to finish and preclude the necessity for using the French armada to do anything but sit around and look menacing. ",
            "So spoiler alert, this is not going to be wrapped up in three months. In fact, it is all going to go so badly that Bonaparte will have to abandon his dream for a French dominated Gulf of Mexico. Instead, when Napoleon was finally exiled for good to Saint Helena, he would tell a companion that the Leclerc expedition was one of his great mistakes. Right up there with the invasion of Russia and the Spanish ulcer. He reportedly said, “With an army of 25,000 to 30,000 blacks, what might I not have undertaken against Jamaica, the Antilles, Canada and the United States itself, or the Spanish colonies?” ",
            "There was an opportunity here to make General Toussaint, his senior officers and the well trained army they commanded partners in his plans for global domination. But instead, Bonaparte chose to try to screw them over and push them all aside. And the really big missed opportunity here is that Toussaint and his Creole army would have been permanently immune to the diseases that ravaged European soldiers arriving in the Caribbean. So once Toussaint got going, it might have been impossible for any European power to stop him. But of course, you get into speculating too hard and you wind up wondering whether Bonaparte taking this route would have also led to him kicking himself, except this time for letting Toussaint Louverture get too powerful. Now, this would all make for a great alternative history, but we should probably get back to the actual history. ",
            "So after the expedition had been forced to wait and wait until the British promised not to interfere, when the go ahead and order came in October, everyone was eager to depart. Whereupon the wind proceeded to blow in the wrong direction for the next seven weeks, trapping the fleet against the Atlantic coast into December and threatening the whole project. Remember, all three steps needed to be completed before the malaria and the yellow fever started to set in. But just as the whole project was seriously about to be scrapped, the winds reversed and in mid-December 1801, the Leclerc expedition set sail. ",
            "But sailing 50 ships across the Atlantic is not an easy job. And the French admiral in charge of the fleet was pretty incredulous at the orders Bonaparte had issued, that the various contingents of ships would all leave the seven Atlantic ports on the same day, sail without problems to a prearranged meeting spot off the coast of Spain arrive there at the same moment and then immediately set sail to arrive in Saint Domingue all together and all at once. The admiral knew that the will of the Atlantic was quite a bit stronger than the will of Bonaparte and he was not wrong. The minute the ships began to depart various storms and mishaps, false starts and perfectly understandable delays wound up scattering the ships all over the map. When the admiral and a core of the fleet got to the rendezvous point, they all waited around for as long as they could for as many ships as they could wait for, but ultimately the admiral had to leave a bunch behind and hope that they would just eventually catch up. ",
            "The fleet wound up delayed long enough that back in Saint Domingue Governor for life Toussaint Louverture had plenty of time to prepare. After learning in December both that peace between France and Britain was at hand and that a massive fleet was gathering on the Atlantic coast, he spent the next two months making ready to defend his island. On paper, Toussaint had close to 20,000 men in the regular army and another 10,000 enrolled in local militias. But those numbers were inflated and Toussaint knew it. Throughout history senior officers and military regimes have always made a habit of inflating their troop numbers, pocketing the wages and supplies they received in excess of their actual numbers. This was a practice winked out at every level. But when it came time to actually fight, the real bill always comes due. ",
            "But Toussaint was no dummy and the militarization of the plantation economy that we talked about last week was in part meant to make it very easy to raise the people to fight, if it came to that, to launch a colonial levée en masse. When soldiers were discharged back to the fields, they took their guns with them. And Toussaint had himself spent the last year or so hiding weapon caches all over the island. And in the months before the fleet’s arrival, Toussaint rode around Saint Domingue making sure everything was where it should be and that his officers holding every fort, garrison and port knew their jobs, which was resist the French for as long as you can but when you can’t resist anymore burn down your town or city retreat to the mountains and will wait until disease kills them all off. ",
            "But though he had carefully prepared and knew that the French were coming, when the French fleet was sighted off the northeast coast of Hispaniola on January 29 1802, Toussaint still despaired at his chances of survival. I think the biggest single batch of soldiers that the French have sent to Saint Domingue so far was 6,000 men. The Leclerc expedition was orders of magnitude beyond that and far beyond what Toussaint was likely expecting. According to the tradition, Toussaint himself was in place to watch for the fleet personally and when he saw the size of it, he said, quote, “We are going to die. The whole of France has come to Saint Domingue.” And remember, he is only seeing part of the fleet. ",
            "Toussaint’s whereabouts over the next week are officially unknown, because that’s the way he wanted it. But there’s a good chance that he rode west as fast as he could and secretly entered Le Cap just ahead of the French fleet. There he would have met in close consultation with the man in charge of Le Cap, General Henri Christophe. Christophe, as I mentioned, will one day be the Emperor of the Kingdom of Haiti. And having just spearheaded the repression of the Moyse’s rebellion, he was now the highest ranking general in the North Province. ",
            "Christophe is an interesting guy and often portrayed as a cultural contrast to Dessalines. Dessalines had grown up in the fields. He was a hard and brutal man who had won his freedom with the sword. Christophe, by way of contrast, had been raised an urban slave serving in a variety of occupations, but is best known as a waiter in and then manager of a prominent Le Cap hotel. Christophe was also a free man when the revolution began, having received his manumission papers just a few years before, now operating the hotel not as a slave but as a free black. So Christophe is urbane, cosmopolitan, used to interacting with men and women of all color and class. He liked lavish parties, sumptuous accommodations and European culture. The contrast between Dessalines, the bloodthirsty field slave and Christophe, the enlightened urban slave is, without question, very overdrawn. But that is the way they are portrayed. ",
            "The ship’s bearing Leclerc and his senior staff arrived outside Le Cap on February 4. When they got there, they found Christophe had removed all the marker buoys from the harbor, so navigating their way in was going to be treacherous. So the best thing to do would be to negotiate with Christophe rather than fighting their way in. But Christophe said, “I can’t do anything until Toussaint gives me the okay. And unfortunately, he’s not home right now.”, which, like I say, was probably a lie to buy some time. Leclerc then reiterated his demand to be allowed into the harbor and Christophe said, “If you try to make me do anything without Toussaint’s permission, I’ll burn the city to the ground. And don’t think I won’t.” ",
            "But though he couldn’t make a direct approach on Le Cap, Leclerc would not just sit back and wait. So he ordered General Rochambeau to take a contingent of troops to go retake Fort Liberté, that key fort east of Le Cap where Jean-François had massacred those whites and where Hédouville had finally come to ruin when he ousted Moyse from his command. Rochambeau’s approach was resisted, but after a good, hard push, the French took the fort. ",
            "Meanwhile, Leclerc himself sailed with the bulk of his men to a landing spot west of Le Cap. But he was outsmarted by Toussaint or Christophe or whoever was actually giving orders inside the city. One of Toussaint’s white supporters talked his way on board Leclerc’s ship and told him that the best place to put in was just a little further west than Leclerc originally planned. Leclerc decided to heed this man’s local knowledge and would not discover for some time that it was actually a trick. The convoy just kept sailing and sailing and getting further and further away from Le Cap. When Leclerc got to this alleged best spot, he realized it was going to take him the better part of a day to march back to the city. ",
            "With the French landing on both sides of Le Cap, Christophe decided their intentions were truly hostile and made good on his threat to burn the city, proving his seriousness by setting fire to his own house first. His men then spread out, lighting fires all over. Distraught residents tried to put these fires out, but the blaze quickly spread out of control, and when it got to the arsenal, that was the ballgame. The arsenal erupted in a furious blast that shook the whole city. So we’re now 8.5 years removed from the great Battle of Le Cap of June 1793. And once again, the Paris of the Antilles is being consumed by fire. When the ravaging flames finally died out, 90% of the city was a burned out wreck, again. Leclerc, meanwhile, got to watch an ominous glow appear on the horizon on the night of February 5, knowing full well now that the first thing he had done upon arriving in Saint Domingue would allow Le Cap to burn to the ground. Not exactly an auspicious beginning. And in reports back to Bonaparte, Leclerc would totally downplay the extent of the destruction. But on February 6, the French converged on the city to find it in ruins and Christophe and Toussaint and all their soldiers nowhere to be found. ",
            "The destruction of Le Cap, though, was good news for one group: the returning colored exiles. They knew that their own position in the expedition was tenuous, but if the French triumphed quickly, they would see the colored officers as a threat to French domination and just deport them all. But with armed resistance brewing, they all knew that their local military knowledge would be indispensable. And this was true for all of them, except André Rigaud. After arriving in Saint Domingue, Leclerc decided that Rigaud was simply too great a threat, with too many loyal contacts to just let loose on the island. So shortly after landing, Leclerc ordered Rigaud deported back to France. But this would not be the end for André Rigaud, and he would not be kept from his home forever, as we’ll see in our very last episode on the Haitian Revolution. ",
            "Now, luckily for General Leclerc, the total destruction of Le Cap turned out to be really the only bad news in the first weeks after his arrival. He had sent ships and soldiers to all the principal ports of Hispaniola with orders to talk their way in and if that failed, then to fight their way in. And his subordinates were far more successful than he himself had been. Especially because plenty of Toussaint’s senior officers were willing to listen to what the French had to say. So the two main ports on the Spanish side, Santo Domingo itself and then another city called Santiago, both fell without a shot being fired. Down in Port-au-Prince, things looked like they were about to get dicey, but the colored commander of the city’s principal fort betrayed this all important fortification to the French. This officer had been a partisan of Rigaud’s, who was subsequently absorbed into Toussaint’s army after the War of Knives and he was all too happy to turn around and stab Toussaint in the back. ",
            "Now, Dessalines was an overall command of the West Province, but he was not in Port-au-Prince to prevent its fall. But he was able to march a loyal force into Léogâne and after determining that it too, would likely fall, he burned it to the ground. Also going up in flames at this point was the plantation owned by Joséphine Bonaparte, which was located just outside of Léogâne. Meanwhile, out on the southern peninsula, the commander of Les Cayes was similarly indifferent to Toussaint personally. And after being assured that he would be able to keep his rank and privileges, and sensing that the French were about to beat Toussaint’s butt, he welcomed a French naval squadron into the harbor. Then Jérémie, never a fan of Toussaint Louverture, soon followed. The only place the French really ran into trouble was around Port-de-Paix, where a general named Maurepas resisted both French overtures and an armed assault. But recognizing that he would not be able to resist forever, General Maurepas burned Port-de-Paix and retreated inland. ",
            "Now, there is a tendency to believe that Toussaint Louverture was always one step ahead of his enemies and that this was all a part of his master plan. But he could not have been thrilled about this opening round of the fight. All of these defections had to have been a blow. And it wasn’t just a few colored or white officers with secret axes to grind. Dessalines, for example, marched from Léogâne to Jacmel to ensure the loyalty of the garrison there and having believed that he secured it, marched out again. Whereupon the black general in charge of the city promptly defected and handed Jacmel over to the French. ",
            "With things going quite well for Leclerc, aside from the little hiccup of Le Cap completely burning to the ground again, he decided to take one good stab at completing step one of Bonaparte’s plan: talk Toussaint out of fighting. Now, Toussaint was himself hiding up near his favorite plantation in Ennery, which was outside Gonaïves. And yes, there is a map to go along with all of this at www.revolutionspodcast.com. ",
            "To act as a go-between, Leclerc brought out Toussaint’s sons, who were, as I said, there for that very purpose. The message they bore was that Toussaint could expect all kinds of awesome treatment and could be assured that slavery was never going to be reestablished just so long as he stood down. Toussaint then demanded an immediate ceasefire to proceed any future negotiations. But Leclerc replied that he could only guarantee that the men under his own immediate control would not fight, but that he couldn’t get word round to any of his other forces, I mean, they’re spread out everywhere. Toussaint took this to be a disingenuous half truth that Leclerc had no intention of ending things peacefully. So negotiations broke down. Toussaint then sent word round to the officer still loyal to him, that they had carte blanche to deal with the French. A sinister little pun. ",
            "So Leclerc is kind of looking like not the savviest operator here. Bonaparte had told him to promise Toussaint anything to get him to stand down. And instead Leclerc is playing cutesy with the promise of a ceasefire. I mean, why not just say, yeah, full ceasefire, great, done. Now, probably this was just a bit of overconfidence, given the good news coming in from everywhere else, but still he’s botching step one. But that said, step two was actually moving along swimmingly as senior officers across the island were taking the French up on their promises to let them keep their commands. And with additional reinforcements coming in every few days as the missing ships arrived, Leclerc decided that the best way to really cement step two was to bring the hammer down on Toussaint, and only Toussaint. Well, technically, Toussaint and Christophe, since they’re both now together. Leclerc declared those two generals fugitives, but only those two generals. Everyone else could expect immediate blanket forgiveness for anything they had done. And that included Dessalines, who is currently marching around the West Province, lighting things on fire and killing anyone who stands in his way. ",
            "Leclerc then also proceeded to bungle the one thing that he really needed to lock down, and that was his supply lines, which were supposed to be running up to the United States. Now, I don’t know if he just hadn’t been properly briefed or what, but when Leclerc got to Saint Domingue, he really did not act as if the Americans were critical to his mission. Instead, he treated all the American merchants in Le Cap as if they were in league with Toussaint, and that his first order of business should be shutting down contraband, going to the enemy, rather than ensuring that his own supply needs were being met. Now, it’s true that the Americans had been supporting Toussaint and some of them would continue to do so. But still, Leclerc treated them all very badly for no good reason. As soon as his fleet arrived in Le Cap, he blockaded the harbor until every American ship could be thoroughly searched. Then he simply decreed that in the future, American ships were forbidden to put in at any port aside from Le Cap and Port-au-Prince. With the American traders now incensed by Leclerc’s heavy handed treatment, they were then really happy to discover that he planned to buy their merchandise not with hard cash, which he didn’t really have, but instead French debt notes, which were trading at, like, 50% face value back up in Philadelphia. So Leclerc is treating the American merchants like the enemy and then underpaying them for their products. Like I say, he’s not really the savviest operator. ",
            "But probably not realizing what a mistake he was making or possibly not caring because this was all going to be over in a few weeks anyway, Leclerc launched a full blown multifront campaign on February 17, 1802. The plan was to converge on the forces still loyal to Toussaint, led by Christophe and Maurepas and Dessalines, and drive them into a single spot where they would be forced to risk a single decisive battle – a battle Leclerc was confident that he could win. The natives might be experts at sneaky gorilla warfare, but they would be no match for the battle hardened regiment of the French army in a set-piece battle. So one column marched south from Fort Liberté, hugging the border with Santo Domingo. Another march south out of Le Cap. Another march southwest towards Gonaïves. A fourth marched east from Port-de-Paix. And then the last column marched north out of Port-au-Prince, all of them pushing towards the heart of Toussaint Louverture country surrounding the old cordon of the west and his favorite plantation in Ennery. And, as I said, there’s a map of all this at www.revolutionspodcast.com. ",
            "Toussaint himself withdrew into a tight mountain ravine that provided a fairly defensible position. But even still, in his first real engagement of the war, Toussaint let General Rochambeau charge up and dislodge him. The governor for life was himself nearly killed, then nearly captured and only barely got away. Meanwhile, outside Port-de-Paix, Maurepas fought as stubbornly as he could but was soon trapped between two French columns, surrounded with no hope of victory, He sent word out that he was ready to accept Leclerc’s blanket pardon and defect along with all his men. ",
            "So now it was down to Toussaint, hiding out with the bedraggled remnants of an army, Christophe in the mountains south of Le Cap and then Dessalines, who’s marching around the West Province, offering no quarter to anyone. Dessalines tried to retake Port-au-Prince, and when that failed, he raced up to Saint-Marc, fought his way in past the small garrison and burned the city to the ground. He then marched into the interior of the West Province, burning and pillaging all before him with especially notorious massacres of white civilians at Mirebalais and Petite-Rivière, which led the French to start counter massacring captured black prisoners and now this is not going to wind up a pretty war at all. ",
            "The early campaign of 1802 peaked in March, when General Dessalines finally holed up in a mountain fortress called Crête-à-Pierrot, setting the stage for one of the most famous battles in Haitian history. The fort had recently been held by the British who had expanded and strengthened it. Dessalines had about 2,000 men with him, but soon after arriving, both Toussaint and Christophe demanded he reinforced their depleted ranks. And pretty soon Dessalines was left with just 1,200 men inside the fort. Believing Dessalines was trapped, General Leclerc decided to storm the fort rather than sit around and wait for a siege to take him down. ",
            "On March 4, the French officer leading the first French units at the scene let his low opinion of the blacks get the better of him. He launched an unsupported attack, promptly lost 300 men and fell back in disarray. A week later, reinforcements arrived, led by Leclerc personally that included a company of Creole defectees led by Alexandre Pétion. As soon as everyone was in place, Leclerc launched a second assault that saw massive casualties on both sides. Leclerc himself was wounded and though the French nearly took the fort, they were repelled at the last minute. After this vicious little battle, neither side showed any interest in letting the other side tend to their dead. And apparently, decades after the fact, there were still skeletons strewn about the remains of the fort. ",
            "But with French honor now on the line, Leclerc couldn’t afford to walk away. The wounded Commander in Chief rode down to Saint-Marc to gather up heavy guns and he had them dragged up to the siege lines. While he did, Dessalines himself appears to have lost his nerve. He told his subordinate officers, “I have to go check on something, but you hold the fort until I send orders that it’s okay to evacuate.” And then he slipped out the back door. By March 22, Leclerc was back at the fort with the heavy guns and he opened up with a constant bombardment. Casualties inside were heavy, but the men refused to give up. Watching this from whatever vantage point he had slipped off to, Dessalines finally decided that holding Crête-à-Pierrot was hopeless and smuggled in order through the lines to tell the remaining forces to evacuate. That night they melted away, sneaking silently right through the French lines. In the morning, the only men left inside the fort were those too sick or too wounded to run. When the French realized that there was nobody defending the ramparts anymore, they marched on in, looked around and massacred everybody left inside. This is not a pretty war. ",
            "The siege of Crête-à-Pierrot is practically the dictionary definition of a pyrrhic victory. Between those killed in the fighting and those dying of their wounds, General Leclerc reckoned he just lost 1,500 men, more men than had been in the fort that he had just taken. And while the French had emerged victorious, Dessalines and about half of his men had gotten away and were still on the loose. But the really important thing was that Dessalines’s heroic and defiant stand against overwhelming odds became the stuff of instant legend. The story spread across the colony undermining with every glorious retelling the aura of inevitability that surrounded the French reconquest of Saint Domingue. There now actually appeared to be a chance that the French could be beaten. ",
            "But that was a seed that was going to take some time to grow. And the immediate military situation facing Toussaint Louverture and his defiant officers was too dire to ignore. They had been surrounded so quickly and so thoroughly that it was hopeless to even try to orchestrate a last ditch levée en masse. In the North Province, Christophe had about 4,000 cultivators already under arms and was raiding around the North Plains, right up to the city limits of Le Cap. But this appears to have just been an excuse to get close enough to say “Hey, I’ll defect if you’ll let me.” After securing a promise from a senior French officer that first, liberty and equality would remain the foundations of any new colonial order and second, that Christophe’s status as a fugitive would be canceled, Christophe defected at the end of April with 1,500 regular troops and those 4,000 armed cultivators. ",
            "With the end in sight, Toussaint finally decided that combat was no longer an effective strategy. On April 29, he sent agents to Leclerc to arrange a ceasefire so that the two men could meet in person. On May 7, at a plantation outside Le Cap, the senior staffs of both sides sat down to talk. Toussaint said that this had all been a great misunderstanding and then secured a promise that he and all his men would be kept in their positions, Leclerc having finally learned that he should promise Toussaint whatever to get him to lay down his arms. The dinner held that night to celebrate the peace was attended by, among others, Dessalines, Christophe, Alexandre Pétion and Jean-Pierre Boyer, who is, remember, just 26 years old. Between them, and in various combinations, these four men would wind up ruling Haiti until the last of them, Jean-Pierre Boyer, was deposed by a coup in 1843. ",
            "But though this was a perfect opportunity to make a bold start to step three of the plan (arrest and deport every creole officer above the rank of captain), Leclerc didn’t do it. He was not sure where he actually stood. And the coda to step two was to use the generals to put down any native uprising. So the dinner party broke up and everyone was allowed to go their own separate ways – a decision that Leclerc would come to regret. ",
            "But though he would not strike at the senior black and colored generals, Leclerc did have his eye on Toussaint and very much wanted to remove him from the island as soon as he was sure that the other generals would not object. Toussaint, meanwhile, was no doubt hoping that he had bought himself the time he needed for disease to take its toll on the French so that he could resume the war. But though disease would start to ravage the French and the war would continue, Toussaint Louverture would not be there to lead it. His estrangement from the black population made him vulnerable and all around him senior officers were cutting deals with the French that did not include provisions for the governor for life. Even Dessalines is suspected of feeding Leclerc rumors that Toussaint was up in his plantation plotting a revolt. ",
            "In June 1802, about a month after the peace, Leclerc decided Toussaint was sufficiently isolated to make his move. Now, he apparently tried to talk Dessalines into making the arrest, but Dessalines refused. So Leclerc settled on one of his own senior white officers. On the pretext of asking Toussaint’s advice on how best to purchase and run a plantation and a hint that this might be the first step towards Toussaint continuing to play a role in the new colonial order, this general lured Toussaint to a plantation house to talk it all through. Toussaint arrived with 20 guards but left them out front while he went inside. And when he went inside, he was arrested. He was then taken quickly to a boat waiting in the harbor at Gonaïves and three days later he was bobbing in the harbor of Le Cap. There he was joined by his wife, niece and two sons. On June 15 1802, the ship carrying the Louverture family sailed away for France. ",
            "Born a Creole slave in Saint Domingue, it was the first time Toussaint had crossed the ocean. Recognizing that this was very likely the end for him he famously told his captors, quote, ",
            "“In overthrowing me, you have cut down in Saint Domingue only the trunk of the tree of liberty. It will spring up again from the roots for they are numerous and they are deep.” ",
            "The ship reached France in July and by August Toussaint Louverture was thrown into the infamous Fort de Joux, a mountain fortress on the border with Switzerland. There he would sit in the cold and the damp and wonder if anyone back home was fighting for his return. ",
            "Back in Saint Domingue, no one was fighting for his return, and this came as a surprise as much to General Leclerc as anyone. He had braced himself for popular revolts, military coups or assassination attempts and none of it came. The arrest and deportation of Toussaint Louverture caused hardly a ripple. And though Toussaint is not technically dead yet, he soon would be. He’s not going to last even a year in prison. ",
            "Toussaint Louverture was a political genius and had he lived in practically any other time or place, he would be as famous as any other great leader in history. I have no doubt that he would have been as adept for example, at maneuvering his way through European war and politics as he was maneuvering his way through colonial war and politics. But he suffers both for being a big fish in a very small pond and because that pond was a successful slave revolt and no other country had an interest in glorifying or promoting the leader of a successful slave revolt. ",
            "But though he was a cunning strategist and blessed with an almost preternatural foresight, at least until the end when he fell for an obvious trap, Toussaint did lack a certain kind of imaginative vision that did help bring him down. He could never see past plantation economics. And so even as he attempted to transcend the racist past of the colony, he simply re-entrenched its economic model as deep as he could, leaving him very unpopular with the people that he had led to freedom. And there were other options out there. Sonthonax had tried to encourage collective ownership of plantations by the workers. Moyse had advocated allowing a small, freehold planter community to emerge that would create some measure of self-sufficiency and, dare I say, economic justice. But Toussaint couldn’t see it. Like everyone else, all he saw was coffee and sugar. ",
            "He was also, we should note, a classic political survivor who ensured his own position first and accounted for everything else second. He did not join the revolt of 1791 until he was sure it had legs. And even then, the first thing he did was try to negotiate everyone back into chains in exchange for freedom and pardons for the leadership. He turned on his old comrades in 1794 the minute he thought fighting against them served his interest better than fighting for them. And after he killed or exiled all his domestic opponents, he imposed an authoritarian labor code that treated the black cultivators with only slightly better regard than the old slave system had. ",
            "Toussaint Louverture was a genius who had a dream for himself and his country that he nearly saw fulfilled, and he deserves to be put alongside the other great men of history. But like all those other great men, he was ultimately incredibly self interested and occasionally a moral catastrophe. ",
            "On April 7, 1803, Toussaint Louverture was found dead in his cell. The cause of death is unknown. He was just about 60 years old. He had steered Saint Domingue from slavery to the brink of independence, but it would be left to other men to complete that journey. Next week, we will join those other men as they attempt to complete the journey. The peace with France will be short lived. The fighting will resume, finally culminating in 1804 with a full blown declaration of independence.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "After arresting and deporting Toussaint Louverture from Saint Domingue in June 1802, the young French General Charles Leclerc was kind of surprised to discover the expulsion of General Toussaint did not immediately spark a mass uprising. The cultivators in the fields had long ago grown disenchanted with Governor for life Toussaint and his senior officers more or less engaged in a conspiracy to sit on their hands and do nothing while their old leader and patron was shipped off. But this was about the only piece of good news Leclerc could point to for the rest of his short life. Because from here on out, his attempt to reassert French control over Saint Domingue was going to be a running disaster. Some of these disasters would be of his own making, some would be beyond his control, but they would all combine to make the Leclerc Expedition one of the all time great debacles in French history. ",
            "But obviously, Leclerc did not know how bad it was going to get and he had some hope that the worst was in fact behind him. The 75 odd day campaign he had waged between mid-February 1802 and the end of April had been hard and bloody, costing him somewhere between 6,000 and 9,000 men. But the fighting was now over and it was time to settle into peaceful administration. And to help him run the colony, Leclerc had with him two senior partners. Possibly reflecting the three man style consulate that governed France, Bonaparte had envisioned a similar three man system for Saint Domingue. Leclerc would, of course, be the captain general in charge of all military matters, but he would be joined by an administrative prefect who would be in charge of the civilian government and a grand judge who would run the legal system. I won’t trouble you with their names because they’re not going to last long once the yellow fever sets in. ",
            "The first problem these guys faced was the problem: how to balance the rights asserted by the free black population with the need to keep them all doing plantation work. Now, Leclerc started out displaying some generous leniency, and he was, in fact, taken aback by how draconian Toussaint’s final labor code was. And he said, “It is so strict that I would never dared to propose one like this, given the current situation.” So, after the ceasefire in May, Leclerc promulgated a new code. And while it was modeled on Toussaint’s, it was not as harsh, and in particular, sought to curb the abuse of cultivators by the soldiers. But the big question on everybody’s mind was: are the French going to reimpose slavery? Now, as we’ll see in a moment, it’s clear that reimposing slavery was Bonaparte’s preference for the colony. But he also seems to have recognized that trying to re-enslave the blacks right away would backfire. Not only is there no evidence that Leclerc departed France with orders to reimpose slavery, but Leclerc himself was an idealistic young man who was on record supporting emancipation. ",
            "But that said, getting the blacks to work was imperative, because, as it turned out, the colony was in much worse shape than Bonaparte or Leclerc had expected. As we discussed two episodes back, the First Consul recognized that the expedition would not be able to feed itself, but he did not realize that it would also not be able to pay for itself. So Bonaparte had sent Leclerc off with almost no hard cash, the general theory being that when Leclerc got to the colony, he would be able to use the mountains of coffee and sugar to get cash that would help him buy more supplies and pay his men. But despite Toussaint Louverture’s best efforts, the Saint Domingue economy had not come close to recovering from ten years of revolution. And on top of that, the two most recent conflicts, the War of Knives and then Leclerc’s own campaigns, represented a major step backward. Cities across the colony, including Le Cap itself, were now burned out husks. Plantations everywhere had been destroyed by advancing and retreating armies over the past two years. Put bluntly, Saint Domingue was not producing what Leclerc needed it to produce to pay for all the other stuff that he needed. ",
            "This lack of hard cash was then compounded by his bad relationship with the United States, from whom he needed to buy supplies. Forcing merchants to take French debt notes as payment was considered little better than theft by the Americans, who then went home and complained. This stirred up a little media firestorm in cities in New England, in the mid Atlantic, and American public opinion turned sharply against the French. ",
            "But it wasn’t just public opinion that Leclerc had to contend with, nor were his own mistakes the sole cause of his problems. The one really big problem was that ever since President Jefferson’s first conversation with the French envoy in the summer of 1801. When he said, “Yeah, we’ll supply you and starve out General Toussaint”, very troubling news had come in from the American ambassador in London. The French and Spanish have signed a secret treaty to retrocede the Louisiana territory. So whatever that expedition in Saint Domingue is up to, it’s part of a much bigger plan than simply reclaiming some little sugar island. The Louisiana territory and access to the Mississippi River were already a huge deal for the American government. The cotton explosion in the south was just getting underway, pushing American planters west. The Spanish controlling access to the Mississippi River was bad enough. The French Republic under Napoleon Bonaparte controlling it? That was something else completely. ",
            "So instead of receiving support from the United States as they expected, General Leclerc’s agents ran into carefully worded proclamations of neutrality. Leclerc dispatched an agent to Philadelphia to float a bond and try to raise some hard cash, and this agent found nothing but hostile refusals to invest. Possibly this was because word had gone round that it wasn’t necessarily in America’s best interest to be supporting this expedition. Failing to raise money in the private sector, these agents then turned to the Jefferson Administration and asked point blank for a loan, to which Secretary of State James Madison said no. Madison wouldn’t even commit to stopping American merchants from trading with any rebels in Saint Domingue, saying only that the merchants wouldn’t be protected by the American Navy. Privately, both Jefferson and Madison were now happy to let the Leclerc Expedition turn into a Caribbean quagmire to forestall whatever other dreams for the Western Hemisphere First Consul Bonaparte may be harboring. ",
            "But money and economics and even international politics were about to become the least of General Leclerc’s worries, because in April 1802, just as the initial French campaigns were winding down, the mosquitoes started to swarm, and the worst yellow fever epidemic on record hit Saint Domingue. Now, disease was expected and had been allegedly accounted for, but the yellow fever epidemic of 1802 came on so fast and was so destructive that it would wreck everything Bonaparte and Leclerc had planned. ",
            "There were two big reasons the epidemic got out of hand so quickly. First, and most obvious, between the soldiers and sailors and their various attendants and families, somewhere just shy of 40,000 people had arrived in the colony from Europe, every one of them susceptible to contracting the disease. Second, though, is that with so much of the urban and municipal infrastructure of the colony devastated, what meager medical accommodations the colony had were totally inadequate. Sanitation was nonexistent. There was no treatment. Hospitals were just places you went to die. And, boy, how did they start to die. ",
            "On May 8, 1802, that is, the day after the peace was worked out with Toussaint and the other Creole generals, Leclerc wrote back to Bonaparte, reporting on the situation. Of the 20,000 soldiers he had come over with, he already was down to just 12,000. Now, most of those were casualties of the recent campaigns, but yellow fever was really starting to take its toll. Leclerc estimated that 200 to 250 men were contracting the disease every day with no end in sight. Hoping that he had accomplished enough of his mission to be relieved, Leclerc then asked to be allowed to return home, no doubt praying that he would be replaced before the yellow fever got to him too. ",
            "Those who contracted the disease followed a predictable clockwork pattern. They would get sick, they would get worse, and then they would die. And any new arrivals in Saint Domingue were now walking into a cloud of death and disease. Through the summer of 1802, men would arrive, step foot on shore and be dead a week later. Both naval and merchant ships would arrive in Le Cap or Port-au-Prince or wherever, and immediately everybody on board would just die. A ship from Bordeaux saw 40 of 48 passengers die within days of arriving. Every single person on a Swedish merchant ship died, except for one cabin boy. The empty ship was then put up for auction. The navy fared no better. And one of the criticisms of Leclerc is that he just let the ships sit anchored in the harbor where their crews died along with everyone else, instead of sending them out to sail around until the plague had gone dormant for the winter. By the end of summer, ships of the line that had crew complements of 400 were now being manned by skeleton crews of just 150, with many of those local coloreds and blacks pressed into service. ",
            "And of course, disease knows no rank or privilege. In short order, the grand judge and the administrative prefect and their entire families were dead. And the senior military staff of the expedition was utterly devastated. In total, 27 high ranking French generals died either in combat or of yellow fever during the Leclerc Expedition, which apparently makes it the single deadliest campaign for French generals for the entire run of the Napoleonic Wars. The officers who had once eagerly signed up for the campaign were now begging to go home. And there was no single assignment more coveted than to be a courier put in charge of Leclerc’s dispatches back to Bonaparte. Getting out of the colony was now every man’s top priority. And just to jump ahead a little bit, by the end of the year, of the 40,000 or so who arrived in February, somewhere on the order of 20,000 to 25,000, would be dead by the end of the year. ",
            "But even with the disease running rampant, Leclerc wanted to keep pushing forward with his plans. And his next step was disarming the population of Saint Domingue. Between the 30,000 guns Sonthonax and the Third Commission had come over with, the munitions left behind by the British when they withdrew and then the additional 30,000 guns Toussaint had bought from the Americans between 1800-1801, it’s estimated there were something like 100,000 guns floating around out in the colony. So once it became clear that the deportation of Toussaint wasn’t going to spark a mass revolt, Leclerc ordered his officers to begin the process of disarmament. And taking the lead in this process would be none other than General Dessalines, who turned his fierce attention on any cultivator who thought they could defy the order to hand over their weapons. ",
            "Dessalines was a black supremacist. Yes, he was. But as he shone in his willingness to crush cultivators under his heel, racial solidarity was not an end unto itself. He was so ruthless in his methods that Leclerc soon nicknamed him ‘The Butcher of the Blacks’ and had very little reason to doubt Dessalines’s loyalty to the French. ",
            "Running parallel to disarmament was Leclerc’s plan to reorganize the military forces under his command. On one side, he had the soldiers who had come over with him from France, and on the other, he had all these black and colored colonial units. Leclerc wanted to integrate these two forces, combining colonial and European units, into single demi-brigades. Now, the standard method of military integration, though, was a lot like any merger between two companies, where the employees of one of the two companies are clearly being favored. As units were combined, entire black companies were simply slated to be disbanded. Drop off your weapons and go home. Now, since these men had a lot riding on their status as soldiers rather than cultivators, they were not happy about this one bit. So many went home, but they did not drop off their guns. Black and colored officers, meanwhile, might be retained, but with far less authority. Generals and Colonels who had grown accustomed to autonomy now answered directly to white officers who hung right over their shoulders. Dessalines, for example, was kept in a state of constant supervision. Lower level officers, captains, and lieutenants found themselves little better than common soldiers now, and they, too, might simply find themselves unceremoniously dismissed from service one day. So anger and resentment was not confined to the men dismissed. It festered in the ranks of those who remained, both because of the indignities they now labored under and the knowledge that their unit might be the next to be disbanded. ",
            "Now, probably what Leclerc should have done is put off any reorganization plan until winter, when the yellow fever had passed and he could properly assess what was actually left of his own strength. But this is hindsight talking, and when he got going with reorganization in June, he did not know that the yellow fever was going to be as bad as it was. Nor did he know that news from France and Guadeloupe and Martinique was going to fatally undermine his authority over the black and colored population. ",
            "Back in France on May 20, 1802, First Consul Bonaparte, who was about to become First Consul for life Bonaparte, by the by, induced his compliant tribune to repeal one of the most revolutionary decrees of the French Revolution, the Law of February 4, 1794, which outlawed slavery everywhere in the French empire. This great law was now null and void. But this was just the de jure confirmation of what had already become de facto consulate policy. Bonaparte had already made it clear in Article 91 of the Constitution that the colonies would be governed by special laws, and he had, in fact, already applied this mentality to the slavery issue. A French colony way off in the Indian Ocean had successfully resisted emancipation. And when Bonaparte came to power, he said, that’s fine, you can keep your slaves. I have no problem with that. Well, now that the Law of February 4 had been repealed, he made this even more explicit by saying that slavery could continue in any French colony where it had not yet been abolished. In the Caribbean, this specifically meant Martinique. ",
            "Now, we haven’t talked about this because we’ve had plenty to talk about, but Martinique had been captured by the British in 1794, and so emancipation had never come to the island. But the recent Treaty of Amiens stipulated that the British would now hand the colony back to France. And so the slaves of Martinique, who had never been freed, would now never be freed. Bonaparte followed this up with an order allowing France and allied merchants to once again partake of the slave trade. And then he followed this up with a law in July 1802, that forbade any black or colored from entering the Metropole, that is all of France, without explicit permission. Bonaparte is turning the clock now back to, like, the 1760s. ",
            "But what would prove even more troubling than the unbroken continuation of slavery in Martinique or the racist laws being passed back in France, were events in nearby Guadeloupe, where emancipation had gone into effect. As a side project, the massive to Leclerc Expedition, Bonaparte had sent a smaller force to Guadeloupe to ensure the Metropole’s authority there, and since there were not as many slaves, nor had Guadeloupe been racked by revolt on the scale of Saint Domingue, the commander of the expedition had orders to reimpose slavery in all but name. And this is beyond even Toussaint Louverture’s Orwellian ‘freedom is slavery’. The commander stripped free blacks of all civil rights, denied them the right to move around, and canceled all wages or profit sharing that may have been implemented since 1794. And this actually did spark a violent rebellion on the island, one that ended dramatically with cornered rebels holed up on a plantation, blowing themselves up rather than accepting re-enslavement. ",
            "But for our purposes here, the important thing was that at an early stage of this fight, the French arrested and deported 1,200 black foremen from Guadeloupe. And at some point in July 1802, French naval vessels holding many of these prisoners paid a call to Le Cap. And while bobbing in the harbor, a number of the captured Guadeloupe foremen managed to escape. When they told their story to the locals in Saint Domingue, word spread through the colony faster than fire through a cane field. Guadeloupe was being re-enslaved. And we are next. ",
            "This chilling news led blacks all over the colony to resist anything Leclerc and his officers were trying to do, which really ticked off Leclerc. On August 6, he sent an angry letter to the First Consul, which said, “I asked you, Citizen Consul, to do nothing that might make the blacks fear for their freedom until I was ready and I was making rapid progress towards that moment. All of a sudden, there arrived the decree that legalizes the colonial slave trade, along with letters from merchants in Nantes and Le Havre asking if they can sell blacks here. Worse still, the General in command of Guadeloupe has just issued an order reestablishing slavery.” ",
            "With the situation now more dangerous than ever, Leclerc asked in this letter and almost all of his subsequent letters, to be relieved of his command requests that would never be granted. ",
            "So though all the senior black and colored military officers and all the soldiers under their command had submitted to French authority, that did not mean that everyone under arms had submitted. As I mentioned back in Episode 4.9, there were all over Saint Domingue independent, unaligned communities of blacks who rejected slavery, the labor codes, plantation work, military service, everything. These communities had not reconciled themselves to André Rigaud or Toussaint Louverture when they had been in charge, and they sure as hell were not going to reconcile themselves to Leclerc. So after the regular army defected to the French, these communities continued to wage guerrilla campaigns from their mountain bases of the interior. And these guys were everywhere in the north, the west, and the south provinces. These communities fought a lonely campaign for independence until the word from Guadeloupe hit, at which point they became the fighting guerrilla wing of a much larger but massively decentralized resistance movement. ",
            "Down in the South Province, especially, black workers in both the cities and the fields started to organize. Their leaders were not grand admirals or governors general, but butchers and fishermen, random foreman and cultivators, certainly as many women as men. The old leadership may have abandoned them, but they were determined to die before returning to slavery. Now, resistance could be as low level as the old slave strategies of work slowdown, sabotage and theft. But in both Jérémie and Les Cayes, out on the edge of the southern peninsula, coordinated efforts aimed at assassination, destruction of property, and probably more soon developed. But the French authorities were on the lookout, and these nascent conspiracies were uncovered and their leaders executed or deported. Except that is now not enough to get the job done, because their places were simply taken by a new cohort of resistance leaders. The summer of 1802 soon turned into one of those classic occupation dynamics, where the French had to continually up their level of repression, which only sparked even greater and wider determination to resist. The woman who today might not want to get involved would tomorrow start plotting to split your throat after you summarily arrest and execute her son on some flimsy pretext. ",
            "On August 25, Leclerc wrote back to Bonaparte, acknowledging the problem. Now, Bonaparte had been pressing him to arrest the black officers and deport them. But Leclerc said, “It seems to me that you do not have a very clear idea of my position to judge from the orders you send me. You order me to send the black generals to Europe. It is quite simple to arrest them all on the same day. But I am using these generals to stop the revolts that are still breaking out and in some districts are taking on an alarming appearance. It is not enough to have deported Toussaint. There are 2,000 leaders here who need deporting.” And frankly, every day there were 2,000 more. ",
            "With resistance brewing, fallout from the military reorganization started to become a major problem. Through July and August, discharged soldiers started merging with the guerrilla bands and the civilian resistance, bringing with them arms, supplies, to say nothing of their military experience and training. And then a principal object of the resistance became getting soldiers still in service to desert their posts and come over to the rebels. And they did. Every day they did. Sometimes it was just one soldier walking away from his post or maybe a small group leaving together. Other times, it would be whole units deserting together. They’d go out on patrol and just never come back. Or even scarier for the white soldiers, blacks would suddenly turn on them in the middle of a fight. They’d all be fighting some guerrilla band together, and suddenly the black soldiers would turn and start firing on the whites, who had minutes before been their quote unquote “comrades”. ",
            "Meanwhile, the senior black and colored officers had grown thoroughly disenchanted with the French. Word that they were now barred from the Metropole, that coloreds were forbidden to use the title ‘citizen’, that the slave trade had been reactivated. It all spelled their inevitable doom. In August, one of Toussaint’s most loyal generals, a guy named Charles Belair, officially Toussaint’s nephew, but possibly his illegitimate son, had already turned and along with his wife Sanité, was secretly coordinating and aiding the rebels of the West Province from his position as a general in the French army. Shortly thereafter, though, he took to the mountains and declared himself in insurrection. But the other generals were not ready to go that far just yet, and General Dessalines took the lead in tracking down the rebellious Belair and Sanité. ",
            "With the colony slipping out of his control, Leclerc’s letters back to Bonaparte showed the general slowly descending into a fog of despair, paranoia, and anger. These letters had two constant refrains: you have to send me more troops and you have to send me home. Perhaps thinking it unseemly for a man to beg for reinforcements while also begging to leave, Bonaparte continued to send more men, but not approve Leclerc’s request to be relieved of his command. ",
            "Between July and October 1802, the First Consul would send 10,000 more men. But with the depressing reports about yellow fever in hand, the First Consul was no longer willing to send his best men and instead started using brigades of foreign auxiliaries from countries now under French domination, mostly Swiss and Germans, but most famously Polish battalions, because you can’t do early modern revolutionary history without the Poles showing up somewhere. So the first Polish legion of 2,500 arrived in early September 1802, after being told that the French were carrying on the struggle for freedom and equality in the New World. But then on arrival, the Poles discovered that this had all been a lie and that clearly the French were fighting to impose slavery, not abolish it. After suffering from a heavy dose of disillusionment combined with yellow fever and death in combat conditions they were not prepared for, the Poles would famously start to defect to the ranks of the blacks, who, it was obvious, were the ones actually fighting for freedom and equality. ",
            "And it was just before the Poles arrived in early September that we get our first piece of really hard evidence that the French were actually fighting for re-enslavement. At the end of August, Leclerc responded to a coded message from the head of the Naval Ministry by saying, quote, “Do not think of reestablishing slavery here for some time. I think I will be able to do everything so that the person who replaces me will have nothing to do but put into effect the government order. But after the innumerable proclamations that I have issued here assuring the blacks of their freedom, I do not want to have to contradict myself. Assure the First Consul, however, that my successor will find everything in place.” ",
            "And from the context of this letter, it’s clear that the government order he referred to was slavery. ",
            "But events were now moving very quickly and Leclerc’s mind was racing. No longer a cavalier idealist, Leclerc was now an aggressive paranoid. He refused to leave his residence in Le Cap and allowed almost no one to enter, hopefully quarantining himself from the plague that swirled all around him. Seeing black and colored rebels everywhere, colonial soldiers deserting to the enemy, and his own men dying like flies. Leclerc’s promise to “have everything in place” was about to take very sinister overtones. Leclerc now believed that to impose French rule he had “nothing left but terror”, and so terror is what he ordered. ",
            "Men and women captured under arms had always been executed. But by the end of summer, the killing became indiscriminate. At the end of August, 60 men were hanged in a single day in Le Cap. In early September, the prisons of Les Cayes were emptied with as many as 350 men and women killed in one mass execution. With plantation foremen now identified as likely resistance ringleaders, it basically became a crime to be a foreman. And arrests and executions were quick and devoid of any legality. French units simply went out on patrol, rounded up anybody who might be a resistance member, which at this point was anyone, and hanged, shot or crucified them as a lesson to the others. But the only lesson the blacks seemed to learn was ‘we have to resist these French bastards at all costs’. ",
            "But the guys who got the worst of it were the black and colored soldiers who remained loyal to the French. The men who had stayed behind when their comrades deserted were not rewarded for their loyalty, but punished for their imaginary future crimes, either because the French officers thought they would inevitably desert or believing that some had stayed behind on purpose to undermine the military from within. Arrests and executions of the men who refused to desert the French became a daily occurrence in September and October, which only, of course, increased the number of desertions. ",
            "The black and colored officers, meanwhile, were all themselves on the verge of deserting. Dessalines, by this point, was no longer destroying the weapons he was seizing. He was stockpiling them for later, or oftentimes, just making a show of disarming civilians and then sending their guns back as soon as the white officers weren’t looking. But it was not just the black generals like Dessalines. Alexandre Pétion, who had come over with the expedition and fought valiantly at the vicious siege of Crête-à-Pierrot in April, was now ready to bolt. Leclerc’s turn to terror, coupled with the news that he was banned from returning to France because of the color of his skin, left Pétion ready to switch sides as soon as it would have the most impact. But there was still some internal maneuvering to contend with. And so while Dessalines, for example, prepared to make his own break, he continued to hunt General Belair and his wife Sanité. Eventually he tracked them down, had them arrested, and then forwarded them on to the French for execution in early October. Belair had often been talked about as the man who might one day succeed Toussaint Louverture as governor. And Dessalines took the opportunity to eliminate a strong rival from the equation before the war of independence got going in earnest. ",
            "In mid-October, though, the time had come for everyone to bolt. The yellow fever epidemic was finally starting to slack. The white forces were now at their weakest and from here on out would only get stronger. General Pétion and another guy named General Clairvaux, who had been one of Toussaint’s top colored officers, had been put in charge of Le Cap’s outer defenses. Specifically, the fortifications were once Sonthonax and Polverel had fallen back to at the battle of Le Cap. There, they made contact with the same guy that Sonthonax and Polverel had made contact with: Macaya. Macaya was still out there running the rebels of the North Plain. And Pétion and Leclerc and Macaya put together a plan for a joint assault on Le Cap. ",
            "This mixed force of regular army and Macaya’s gorillas struck on October 13. And before the Frenchmen manning Le Cap’s inner line knew what was happening, a horde of black and colored soldiers were upon them. This attack finally brought Leclerc out of hiding, and he personally rushed to the walls to lead the defense. In all likelihood, he probably did not think he was going to make it out of this alive, but Leclerc and his men somehow held the line. And when morning dawned, Le Cap had not fallen. But though this attack failed, it was the signal that it was time for everyone to pick sides once and for all. Christophe defected on October 16 and attacked Port-de-Paix. Dessalines, who probably knew what Pétion was about to do, turned on his superiors and on October 24, attacked Gonaïves. And with the atrocities committed by the whites, you can bet that no quarter was offered to anyone who fell into the hands of the rebels. ",
            "The generals made their move not a moment too soon, because by this point, Leclerc had snapped completely. On October 7, just days before Pétion’s attack on Le Cap, Leclerc wrote what turned out to be his last letter to Bonaparte, and in it he said, ",
            "“Here is my opinion of this country. You must destroy all the blacks of the mountains, men and women, and keep only children under twelve years old, destroy half those of the plain, and not leave in the colony a single man of color who has worn an epaulet. Otherwise the colony will never be quiet. And at the beginning of each year, especially after murderous seasons like this one, you will have a civil war that will comprise the possession of the country. If you wish to be the master of Saint Domingue, you must send me 12,000 men without wasting a single day.” ",
            "Seeing nothing but an island of men and women who would never accept French rule, Leclerc was now advocating a program of nothing less than genocide. Basically, his plan was to wipe out the entire population of Saint Domingue so that they could start over with new slaves from Africa. And it would appear that Leclerc was not joking. After the attack on Le Cap, he issued a general arrest order for every black and colored soldier still under French authority. The thousand or so black men of the Le Cap garrison, unfortunate enough to have remained loyal to the French, were rounded up and marched on to ships waiting in the harbor. On Leclerc’s orders, sacks of flour were tied around their necks and they were unceremoniously pushed overboard. In a single day, these thousand men were drowned one by one in the Le Cap harbor, their bodies washing ashore over the course of the next week. And as had happened in the Vendée, mass drowning soon became the quickest and most cost effective method of execution. And one white officer who was sickened by the slaughter estimated that something like 4,000 men and women were drowned across the colony over October and November 1802. This would mark the beginning of a cycle of horrific atrocities and counter atrocities committed by both sides in the War of Independence that can now be said to have officially begun with the defection of the generals in October. ",
            "But though Leclerc set it in motion, he would not live long enough to do anything but set it in motion. Very possibly as a result of the contact he had had with the troops during the battle to defend Le Cap, General Leclerc came down with a fever on October 22. He hung out in okay shape for a few days, but on October 29, he collapsed and was stricken with the very worst that yellow fever has to offer, which I’ll spare you the very gross details of. On November 2, 1802, almost exactly a year after marrying into the Bonaparte family and being put in charge of this all important mission, Leclerc died at the age of 30. ",
            "But as I just said, Leclerc’s death was an end to nothing but his own life. Next week, the War of Independence will be waged in brutal earnest as both sides sought to terrorize and murder the other into submission. General Dessalines will merge as the commander in chief of the Creole rebels and with him would come the final death of Toussaint Louverture’s dream for tricolor harmony. There could be no peace, no liberty, no independence for the blacks and colors of Saint Domingue if even a single white was left alive.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "When we started this series on the Haitian revolution, I said that we’d be covering events from the initial revolts of 1791 through to independence. And as you may have noticed, today’s episode is called “Independence”. But don’t freak out. This is not suddenly the final episode of the series. It is rather the third to last episode of the series. But today we will indeed make it to the final Declaration of Independence on New Year’s Day 1804. Then next week, we will cover Jean-Jacques Dessalines’s consolidation of the newly independent nation of Haiti, which will be preceded on a nightmarish purge of every white left in the colony. But that is where the arc of our revolutionary narrative will conclude. But we’re going to wrap things up completely the week after that with as concise a history of Haiti as I can write to bridge the gap between independence and today, because I think it will be really helpful to put all of this in a final historical context. We’ve already developed a lot of the threads that go on to define the future course of Haitian history, so it’ll really just be a matter of following those threads through to the end. Then after that, I will go on break to prepare for our fifth cycle of episodes covering Simón Bolívar, Grand Columbia and the struggle for Spanish-American independence. ",
            "So we left off last time with the death of General Leclerc, just the latest victim of the yellow fever epidemic of 1802. But the ironic thing is that Leclerc actually managed to survive the yellow fever epidemic. By the time he died in early November 1802, the death clouds that had swept through the colony had more or less dissipated for the winter, and Leclerc was actually among the last men to die of yellow fever in 1802, which I’m sure was a huge consolation for him. ",
            "Leclerc was succeeded by his second in command, General Rochambeau, who has been popping in and out of the story ever since Episode 4.6, when he appeared just after the arrival of the Second Commission. But if we push it back even further, Rochambeau has actually been lurking around since way back in Episode 2.12, “Yorktown”. He served his father as an aide-de-camp during the American War of Independence and upon his return to France, obviously stayed in the army all through the French Revolution, even after his father quietly resigned in 1792, which we talked about in Episode 3.22, “War”. ",
            "Now, the Rochambeaus were old style liberal nobles, and after years of service in the Caribbean, Rochambeau the Younger wound up adopting the worldview of the old big whites. He was an enlightened supporter of free trade and self government and property rights, but simultaneously retrograde on more revolutionary ideals like liberty and equality. To be blunt, Rochambeau was a racist who did not think that blacks or coloreds deserved or were even capable of enjoying political, economic and social equality. Rochambeau also supported slavery and was party to the long intellectual tradition, which is somehow still floating around out there I might add, that blacks were better off as slaves. So when Rochambeau took over the French occupation in November 1802, he made little secret of the fact that his goal was the re-establishment of white supremacy and the re-enslavement of the blacks. In fact, he would soon say, quote, “The white color is now waging a war against the two others, and the colony needs to molt.” Then, on January 1st, 1803, he asked the naval minister for permission to formally restore slavery. ",
            "But if you can believe it, none of that is why General Rochambeau winds up one of the most hated figures in Haitian history. Well, I mean, it is, but there’s a lot of guys out there who oppose liberty and equality. So why does Rochambeau’s name conjure up such a specific hate? ",
            "Well, I will tell you. He took Leclerc’s belief that terror-is-all-I-have-left and just ran with it. ",
            "Now, it’s worth pointing out that Rochambeau actually pulled back from the genocidal plans that burst from Leclerc’s fevered imagination. And the terror program that he is about to implement was not about mass indiscriminate killing. But if you were caught as a rebel under arms or were linked to seditious activity, you became a target for some truly sadistic forms of punishment, which we’ll come back to in a minute. ",
            "The military situation that Rochambeau inherited was basically this: first, most of the French troops who had come over back in February were now either dead, wounded or invalids. Reinforcements that had arrived over the summer were in no better shape. If I’ve done my math right, by the end of 1802, somewhere close to 30,000 European soldiers had been sent to Saint Domingue. When Rochambeau took over, he could count on about 3,000 men who could actually stand up and fight. On top of that, the colonial forces, the blacks and coloreds had almost all defected. All that was left were a few colored officers who just couldn’t quite believe that serving alongside the blacks was better than serving alongside the French. ",
            "So the first thing Rochambeau did was write back to Paris begging for reinforcement. He reckoned he would need as many as 35,000 more men to finish the job, which is insane, but you gotta ask. While he waited for these reinforcements, Rochambeau settled into a strategy of pure defense and though he only had about 3,000 healthy men across the island, those forces turned out to be adequate for a strategy of pure defense. For the whole course of the revolution, the native forces have never been great at assaulting fortified positions and the winter of 1802-1803 was no different. Le Cap itself was assaulted repeatedly but the French also easily fended off various attacks on Môle-Saint-Nicolas, Saint-Marc, Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, Les Cayes. All of them held firm. ",
            "But these constant attacks hid what was really going on out there over the winter of 1802-1803 and why the French could easily defend themselves with so few men. Because, as it turned out, the blacks and coloreds were not actually focused on expelling the French just yet. Instead, they were focused on consolidating the disparate rebel forces into a single unified rebel army. ",
            "So these various rebel forces fell into four basic categories. ",
            "First, there was the cohort of men surrounding the black generals like Dessalines and Christophe. These guys had all come out of Toussaint Louverture’s army and had been serving together for years. They had defected to the French back in May and then turned around and redefected back into rebellion in October. ",
            "Second, there were the colored generals and their men. Most of these guys had been partisans of André Rigaud and if they hadn’t actually served in Rigaud’s Legion of the South, they were at least very strong independent allies of it. Most of these colored officers, Alexandre Pétion, now the most prominent among them, had been exiled to France after the War of Knives. Then they had come back with the Leclerc expedition and only abandoned the French when Leclerc started to lose his marbles. ",
            "Third, there were all those independent guerrilla communities out there that had never reconciled to Toussaint or Rigaud or the French. And I didn’t talk about this last week, but these guys were almost uniformly African born. They had come to Saint Domingue just before the revolution had begun. And until just a few weeks ago, these guys had been fighting units led by Dessalines and Christophe and Pétion. ",
            "Finally, there was just a mass civilian population. Nearly all of them were now engaged in some level of resistance. And while they were never going to be properly trained or armed, they were all now ready to die before submitting to re-enslavement. ",
            "So over the winter of 1802-1803 three, there were amongst these four groups maneuverings and counter maneuvering, alliances and counter alliances, all aimed at answering two basic questions. First, will these various rebel factions be unified into a single rebel army? And second, if there is a unified army, who will be its commander in chief? ",
            "And despite the aura of inevitability that Jean-Jacques Dessalines’s rise to power takes in hindsight, it was not a foregone conclusion in November 1802 that Dessalines would emerge as the commander in chief of a unified rebel army. He was not popular with anybody. During the War of Knives, for example, Dessalines had led the brutal siege on Jacmel, while Alexandre Pétion had been the one enduring that brutal siege. And then, of course, just a few months ago, their roles had reversed with Dessalines inside Crête-à-Pierrot and Pétion leading the attack from the outside. So reconciliation between those two guys was not a sure thing. And then, of course, Dessalines had been playing bad cop for both Toussaint and the French. So both the independent communities out there and the cultivators kind of hated Dessalines’s guts. ",
            "But Dessalines had one big thing going for him. He was now the preeminent leader of the black regular army. Since this was now the largest, best trained and most cohesive part of the rebel forces, Dessalines’s word counted for a lot. Jean-Jacques Dessalines was not a beloved man. A lot of his new allies didn’t even respect him. But he could not be ignored. By the end of the year, even Pétion had reconciled himself to taking orders from his old enemy and he acknowledged Dessalines’s supreme authority. ",
            "Then Dessalines spent the next few months bringing everyone else into his command structure. Up in the North Province, for example, Christophe was trying to exert the army’s authority over the independent communities but was running into trouble because those independent communities had just spent most of the summer fighting against Christophe. One of their leaders, in particular a guy named Sans-Souci, was incredulous that he was now expected to obey Christophe’s orders. So in January, Dessalines rode up to try to broker a peace between Sans-Souci and Christophe. This attempt appears to have failed, however. But after Dessalines rode back to his headquarters in the mountains of the West Province, Christophe invited Sans-Souci to dinner to try again and promptly assassinated him. Which was no doubt personally gratifying but also a warning to the other independent leaders: either put yourself under our authority or we’re going to kill you. Most of the independents would ultimately resign themselves to joining, but more than a few said “Forget it!” and actively helped the French from here on out, even with Rochambeau’s little reign of terror running in the background. ",
            "And so that brings us back around to Rochambeau’s little reign of terror. In the main, the best way to understand this is as a return to all of the terrible slave punishments that we talked about way back in Episode 4.2, Rochambeau is already talking about the blacks as if they’re a bunch of runaway slaves. He’s actually writing and speaking of them in those terms. So it’s natural that his reign of terror would take its cues from the old slave regime. And just like the old plantation managers and overseers, Rochambeau and his men developed cute little names for all the various forms of torture and murder that they were about to dole out. ",
            "To drown a man was to give a codfish a bath. A mass drowning was netting a big prize. Hanging a man was to promote him. Crucifying him was to raise him in dignity. Burning prisoners alive was called a hot operation and was usually done on a bed of cane stalks, which quickly blazed into torturous infernos. And though there is no name for it, Rochambeau’s men also discovered that you could kill a whole bunch of prisoners at once by locking them in the hold of a ship and pumping in sulfur gas. All over the island, this kind of exemplary terror became a daily occurrence even as it ceased to have any exemplary effect, because almost the whole population was now dead set on resisting the French at all costs. They weren’t even cowed. They were emboldened. And in the various battles and skirmishes of what was fast becoming a War of Independence, unarmed cultivators would simply run at the French line, only to get mowed down. So they wind up serving as little more than human shields for the better trained black and colored troops following them. But everyone was in live free or die mode. Before he died, Leclerc even commented on this in a letter to Bonaparte, saying, “The men die with incredible fanaticism. They laugh at death, and it’s the same with the women.”",
            "By far the most infamous of Rochambeau’s terrorist tactics, though, were the dogs. Yes, the dogs. Shortly after he took over, Rochambeau inquired through French agents in Cuba about the possibility of purchasing special hunting dogs who had been trained to track down and attack runaway slaves. Rochambeau wanted to use these kinds of dogs to find rebel army camps, and on March 1st, 1803, the first batch of about 200 dogs arrived in Le Cap. What followed was an infamous incident that has to be fair, been embellished almost beyond recognition, but which remains at its core an act of horrifying cruelty. ",
            "Rochambeau wanted his new dogs to make a good first impression, and so he set up a fenced area in the courtyard of the government house in Le Cap, and into this enclosure, he put one of the dogs and then dropped in a black prisoner. The French spectators joked that this prisoner was descending into the arena in a deliberate classical reference to the old myth of Christians being fed to the lions. Rochambeau expected the dog to maul the prisoner, but apparently the dog was not interested. And so, and this is terrible and gross, but bear with me. A French officer climbed into the arena and slit the victim’s belly, which got the dog interested enough to attack. ",
            "Now, in the fullness of time, this incident has morphed into Rochambeau making a habit of feeding blacks to dogs. But as far as I can tell, it all goes back to this one incident. And just so you know, there is a version of this story that ends with the dog never getting interested and the prisoner living and later being released. ",
            "Now, this is not to say that Rochambeau wasn’t now revealing himself as a debauched sadist. He is and clearly was. But the myth of the dogs has overtaken the reality. But just to wrap up with them, the dogs weren’t even particularly effective in war. When they did go out on patrol, they usually just got in the way. And in one particular battle, they wound up attacking the French troops who were trying to retreat from a particularly vicious counterattack. ",
            "But like I just said, even after you peel back the layers of myth from Rochambeau’s terror, you’re still left with this guy as a despicable sadist, because his other most infamous moment comes shortly after relocating his headquarters back to Port-au-Prince in mid-March 1803. After arriving, he invited a group of colored ladies to attend a banquet. When dinner was over, he led them to an adjacent room that had been decked out in morbid black decorations. And in the center of the room were four coffins topped with skulls, which, according to the report, the ladies were told contained, quote, their loved ones. Now, it’s hard to tell if there were actually dead bodies in these coffins or if this was just some kind of elaborately cruel warning to the coloreds. But whichever it was, Rochambeau was, off to one side, delighting in the horror and tears of these poor women. So even if he didn’t do all of the things he was later accused of doing, General Rochambeau was a sick puppy. ",
            "So while this was all unfolding in Saint Domingue, events back in Europe, as usual, are about to dictate the course of the Haitian revolution. In January 1803, First Consul Bonaparte got the news that his brother-in-law Leclerc was dead and that the expedition was in very bad shape. Shortly thereafter, he got Rochambeau’s various requests for 35,000 men. And while that was never going to happen, over the next few months, the First Consul would continue to send more troops, though now even foreign auxiliaries were too valuable to send into what was clearly a death trap. Bonaparte was now sending off mostly captured deserters, various criminals and political enemies, though another 2,500 Poles did get thrown into the mix. In all, another 10,000 or so soldiers would be sent by the summer of 1803, even though by then it was clear that this whole mission was a lost cause. Partly because, yes, Saint Domingue had turned out to be a death trap, but also because the recently achieved peace with Britain was already breaking down and a new war was fast approaching. ",
            "As late as early winter 1802, Bonaparte still held fast to his dream of a French dominated Gulf of Mexico and an expedition was outfitted in Holland that was supposed to sail for New Orleans and begin the process of taking over Louisiana. But the expedition had been delayed and delayed and delayed long enough that the harbor froze and the fleet was stuck in place. By the time the ice started to break apart in the spring, relations between France and Britain were breaking apart even faster and Bonaparte scrapped any plans to send this fleet off to the western hemisphere. In fact, recognizing that between the British navy and any American force that might join them, taking control of Louisiana was probably now out of the question and that his best bet would be to sell the land to the Americans. Which would A) generate some much needed cash to finance the war that he was about to start back up, and B) maybe generate enough goodwill with the American government to stop them from joining any nascent anti-French coalition. ",
            "On the other side of the Atlantic, this is exactly what President Jefferson and Secretary of State Madison wanted to hear. They had been greatly distressed to learn about France’s acquisition of Louisiana, but they had been having a hard time expressing this distress to the French because Foreign Minister Talleyrand kept swearing on a stack of bibles that there was no secret treaty with Spain, Louisiana had not been retroceded to the French and that the Americans are crazy. Where did you hear these crazy rumors? That’s crazy! ",
            "As late as March 1803, the American ambassador in Paris, a guy named James Livingston, despaired at the whole situation. He wrote that the French weren’t ever going to talk about Louisiana. No mix of carrots or sticks would convince them to even admit it was now theirs to talk about. Whereupon Talleyrand called Livingston in for a meeting on April 10 and said, “Of course we have Louisiana. We’ve always had Louisiana. What are you daft? Anyway, we want to sell it to you. And not just some of it, the whole thing, lock, stock and barrel.” And so they did. In exchange for 60 million livres worth of cash paid over 15 years, the United States of America bought the Louisiana territory from the French consulate. ",
            "Now, as a hilarious coda to all this, there was a clause in the treaty with Spain that stipulated that the French would not dispose of the territory without consulting the Spanish government, which Bonaparte and Talleyrand did not do. And then Jefferson’s White House, of course, had no constitutional authority whatsoever to be making this kind of purchase. It’s actually one of the most famous cases of executive overreach in American history. But Bonaparte wanted to sell and Jefferson wanted to buy, and so they just did it. Anyway, this is all to say that the single greatest land acquisition in American history, land that doubled the size of the United States and still amounts to about 25% of its total land mass, was all basically thanks to the Haitian revolution. ",
            "Before we head back to Saint Domingue, I should also note in passing the final passing of Toussaint Louverture, because it was here in April 1803, the guard came in to check on Toussaint and found him dead beside the fireplace. Cause of death was most likely pneumonia, but it was never definitively diagnosed. But while Toussaint is now dead, all of his former lieutenants are about to make the final successful push for independence from France. ",
            "As the terms of the Louisiana Purchase were being worked out, and as old Papa Toussaint was dying, General Rochambeau was ready to launch his only offensive campaign of the war. He had gotten some reinforcements over the winter and now had enough men recovered from injury and disease to launch a campaign in the South Peninsula. Four columns of 500 men each, so 2,000 men total, would march east along both the north and south coast of the peninsula, setting out from Les Cayes and Jérémie respectively. And these guys would clear out rebel nests and pacify the territory in between, with the ultimate plan being to create a cordon that would block rebel access to the South Peninsula and then they would roll up the colony from there. But this campaign turned out to be a debacle. The columns did a terrible job communicating with each other, independent rebel forces turned out to be everywhere, and the whole thing was just one long bloody skirmish. Everything stalled out and achieved nothing. ",
            "From this point on, Rochambeau is basically inert. He told his forces to sit tight in whatever city they happen to be holding, man the walls, and wait for the wave of reinforcements that he really hoped were about to appear on the horizon. ",
            "In hindsight, May of 1803 turns out to be the great pivot point of the War of Independence and the month when the French really and truly and forever lost control of Saint Domingue. Because in May, two really important things happened. First, the rebel army formally consolidated under the leadership of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. And second, war with Britain started up again. And in short order, the British navy would be moving in to blockade all the French held cities of Saint Domingue. ",
            "Now, since the rear rival of the British is pretty self explanatory, I want to focus in on events in the rebel camp, and especially a meeting held at the city of Arcahaie, a little town in between Port-au-Prince and Saint-Marc. I think aside from the Bois-Caïman ceremony that kicked all of this off, there is no more mythically patriotic moment in the Haitian revolution. The bare facts, as known, are pretty straightforward. By May 1803, Dessalines had come to terms with Pétion, but a few of the other old colored generals were still skeptical. Meanwhile, the independent black leaders were ready to join a final push to drive the French out, but probably wanted assurances that Dessalines wasn’t just going to turn on them as soon as the French were gone. So all these leaders got together in Arcahaie to hammer out their differences. There’s no official record of what happened or who said what, but we do know that from this point on, Dessalines will be recognized as the commander in chief of what is now being called the indigenous army. ",
            "But in the national mythology of the Haitian revolution, this meeting at Arcahaie represents the moment of final unity between the blacks and the colors, represented by the adoption of a new flag for the indigenous army. Until now, the regular army units at least, had continued to use the tricolor flag in battle. But Pétion had pointed out to Dessalines that this might be giving people the impression that reconciliation was still possible. So to leave no room for doubt that this was all now about independence, Dessalines dramatically cut the middle white stripe out of the tricolor flag. He said, the time has come to stop letting the whites keep the blacks and coloreds apart, and he tossed the white section aside. He then had his goddaughter Catherine Flon sew the blue and red sections back together to create a new bicolored flag. Blue representing the blacks and red the coloreds. Haiti continues to celebrate May 18 as Flag Day. That’s how important this moment is to the national mythology. ",
            "Now, did any of this actually happened? I’ll go with maybe, kind of, yes and no. ",
            "For one thing, it’s disputed whether Pétion or Dessalines was the one who first proposed the bicolored flag. Then there is evidence that the tricolor had been dropped actually back in December rather than at this all important Arcahaie meeting. And then further, there is subsequent evidence that the flag adopted by the indigenous army was not based on the tricolor at all, that it was not blue and red, but rather black and red. And then other reports counter this and say, oh, no, it was blue and red after all. If I’m feeling particularly lucid when I draft my concise history of post revolutionary Haiti, I’ll try to tie the fate of the Haitian flag into it, because its color, its meaning and its legacy will change depending on contemporary Haitian politics. If you Google it, the current Haitian flag is indeed the blue and red bi-color but it’s only been that since 1986 that was after Baby Doc Duvalier was overthrown, because the Duvalier regime used the black and red flag. And so, yes, hopefully I’ll be feeling lucid because the design of the flag does mirror the course of Haitian politics. ",
            "Anyway, the indigenous army emerged on May 18, unified and ready to settle for nothing less than independence. Except, again, maybe not, because there are reports that as late as the summer of 1803, Dessalines himself was still not convinced that independence was actually the goal here. But now I’m just being a buzzkill and getting in the way of a good story. ",
            "The emergence of the indigenous army was ominous enough for the French, but even more ominous was the news that war with Britain was back on, which they found out because the British navy showed up to blockade their ports. Rochambeau and his men were now completely cut off, both from France and from each other. ",
            "This is all incredibly good timing for Dessalines and his new indigenous army, though. In June, he’s writing letters to both the British governor in Jamaica and the American government requesting both arms and supplies. The Americans, like a broken record, said that they were going to maintain neutrality, so they wouldn’t formally commit to anything. But American merchants, as usual, were all too happy to trade with Dessalines’s army. The British, meanwhile, were more upfront about everything and just made it a part of their war strategy to arm and supply the rebels, not because they supported the rebels, but because sowing chaos in Saint Domingue was an end unto itself. ",
            "So in the summer of 1803, the French cause is looking mighty hopeless. Besieged on land by the indigenous army and blockaded by sea by the British, things went from bad to worse. Yellow fever cropped back up, and though it was not as bad as it had been the year before, men and women were dying daily from the disease. And this was to say nothing of the famine that started to set in. And in case you’re wondering what happened to all the dogs, yeah, they went into the bellies of starving French soldiers. ",
            "With Rochambeau making no move to break out of this trap, the indigenous army now pretty much had the run of the colony, except for the few coastal holdouts, well armed and well supplied by the British and Americans, Dessalines undertook a methodical campaign of driving the French out of the various ports one by one. In July 1803, the French still occupied ten cities across the colony, and Dessalines’s strategy was simple: maintain a small covering force around each city to keep the French pin down, then mass everyone else at one particular city, force that particular city to surrender and move on. ",
            "The first of all was Jérémie. The French commander of the garrison was a particularly scummy scumbag, so the inhabitants of the city wanted him gone. And then the Polish soldiers under his command started defecting over to the rebels and the French position became untenable. On August 3, the French tried to evacuate by sea but were captured by the British and taken to Jamaica as prisoners of war. ",
            "The rest of the cities then fell one by one. On September 2, the Saint-Marc garrison just surrendered outright to the British navy and then in early October, the garrison in Les Cayes did the same thing and that became the basic pattern: the French forces surrendering to the British in exchange for getting them the hell off the island. Fort-Liberté and Port-de-Paix followed them soon after. Dessalines personally led the encirclement of Port-au-Prince using guns captured from Saint-Marc, but he would not have to use them. The garrison commander said, “If you let us leave peacefully, I won’t blow the city up on my way out the door.” Dessalines agreed to these terms and 1,500 soldiers and fully 3,000 civilians fled in a small fleet that somehow, and I’m honestly not sure how, slipped the British blockade and made it over to Cuba. By November 1803, only Le Cap and Môle-Saint-Nicolas were still under French control. ",
            "Inside Le Cap, Rochambeau, his officers and their entourage had turned the city into an end times little fantasyland, like how you might expect things to go if we all get told a meteor is going to come destroy the earth, and it all sounds pretty surreal. Rochambeau and company continued to throw parties every night, dance, drink, indulge in love affairs, get in fights over women kind of the way you might expect things to go when the end of the world is at hand. ",
            "The end of the world finally came on November 18, 1803, at the most famous battle in Haitian history this side of the siege of Crête-à-Pierrot, the Battle of Vertières. The indigenous army under Dessalines massed a force of 15,000 men outside Le Cap, symbolically centered on the plantation where the first slave revolt had been planned in August 1791. The last remnants of the French army, numbering about 2,700 plus 500 local militia, fought as best they could and the casualty rate spoke to how well they fought. The indigenous army absorbed 1,200 dead and 2,000 wounded and the French just 130 dead and 400 wounded. But the overwhelming numbers of Dessalines’s army were overwhelming. The French were forced to retreat and the road to Le Cap was wide open. ",
            "Mostly understanding that the end had finally come, Rochambeau negotiated a surrender with Dessalines similar to the terms that had been worked out at Port-au-Prince: if you let us leave peacefully, I won’t destroy the city on my way out the door. Dessalines agreed and gave the French ten days to evacuate. But when the ten days were up, he found that Rochambeau was still just kind of dithering around, mostly trying to figure out a way to escape without being taken prisoner by the British. But by then, the British had closed the harbor completely, and there was no slipping through their blockade. Dessalines led 2,000 men into the city, and Rochambeau had to admit that it was all over, and he and his men surrendered to the British. The last of the French occupation, about 3,800 troops, administrators and their families boarded the last 17 ships of the French navy and were sailed back to England as prisoners of war. They left behind somewhere between 500 and 800 men who were too wounded or sick to leave, all of whom were massacred by Dessalines’s army. ",
            "Between all the sailors and all the soldiers who had been sent to Saint Domingue in the 18 months since the Leclerc Expedition had first landed back in February 1802, the final death toll was just about 50,000. Now, since Napoleon will eventually kill 238,000,000,000,000 people trying to invade Russia, this is not the worst military disaster in French history. And in fact, Napoleon’s future disasters will tend to block out the memory of the Leclerc Expedition. But they shouldn’t. The French came in thinking that they were going to reconquer Saint Domingue, reinstitute white supremacy, re-enslave the blacks, and then go out and conquer the whole Caribbean. Instead, a handful of survivors were now being taken back to Britain as prisoners of war, and the blacks and coloreds were preparing to declare independence. Saint Domingue is now lost to the French forever. ",
            "Dessalines and his lieutenants did not waste much time proclaiming independence. On November 29, 1803, a declaration signed by Dessalines, Christophe and Clairvaux, all former generals under Toussaint Louverture, announced to the world that Saint Domingue was no longer a part of the French Empire. It was free and it was independent. ",
            "But this turned out to only be the first hastily thrown together declaration. It promised that life in the colony would go back to the way it had been before the Leclerc Expedition had shown up and pointedly still referred to this new independent nation as Saint Domingue. But about a month later, Dessalines was ready to be far bolder in his proclamations. Wanting to capture a real spirit of independence, he commissioned a new declaration. But the one that came back to him on December 31, 1803, was still not good enough. It was modeled on the American Declaration of Independence and spent a lot of time just rattling off a list of legalistic complaints. And Dessalines complained that it was flat out boring as hell. But he had already scheduled a big party for New Year’s Day to read the new declaration. And so another secretary stepped forward and promised to give Dessalines what he wanted. According to the official story, this guy said, ",
            "“In order to draw up our active independence, we need the skin of a white to serve as parchment, his skull as an inkwell, his blood for ink and a bayonet for a pen.” ",
            "Dessalines liked the sound of that and told the guy to get to work, which the guy did later saying, “After two cups of coffee and three shots of rum, the words came naturally.” ",
            "As I did with the American Declaration of Independence, along with this episode is a supplemental full reading of the Haitian Declaration of Independence, complete with its references to the French as vultures and tigers and swearing them eternal hatred and death if they ever tried to come back. It’s quite a bit livelier than the American Declaration, and when Dessalines read it on New Year’s Day 1804, the new nation of Haiti was born, because in this declaration, he renamed the colony Haiti after the old Taino name for Hispaniola, and this new nation of Haiti would remain free and independent from that moment on. It was the second nation in the Western Hemisphere to declare independence from its colonial masters. ",
            "Next week, though, Dessalines will take care of the last remnants of white power in the now former colony of Saint Domingue by ordering the execution of every white left on the island. And when that was done, he boldly declared himself Emperor Jacques I of Haiti.",

            "The Declaration of Independence, proclaimed by Jean-Jacques Dessalines on New Year’s Day 1804, which I hope everybody listened to, was much more a call to arms than a traditional declaration of political independence. And with the declaration composed in French, it is clear that Dessalines wanted the French to know what he was about to do and why he was about to do it. That declaration said, ",
            "“Let them tremble when they approach our coast, if not from the memory of the cruelties they perpetrated here, then from the terrible resolution that we will have made to put to death anyone born French whose profane foot soils the land of liberty.” ",
            "And this was not just a threat. This was a promise. A very terrible promise. ",
            "Dessalines wasted no time making good on his terrible promise because there were still French born men, women, and children on the island. By early February, Dessalines and his entourage had established a headquarters in Port-au-Prince, and the name was, at this point officially and forever changed back from Port Republican, which it had been officially called since 1793. In Port-au-Prince, Dessalines convened a commission to investigate atrocities committed by the French. Mostly, this was focused on specific acts committed during the recent occupation by Leclerc and Rochambeau. But it was also interested in compiling a general list of crimes going back into the days of the old slave regime. None of this was with an eye to identifying guilty individuals or their specific victims. This was about establishing the collective guilt of the white French citizens and soldiers of Saint Domingue. Dessalines wanted a huge list of crimes he could point to in order to justify what he was about to go do, which was commit genocide. ",
            "In very short order, just a few weeks, Dessalines had what he wanted, and he sent out the first batch of orders to garrison commanders in Léogâne, Jacmel, and Les Cayes. Kill the whites, round them up, put them in custody, and then kill them all. But this being a pretty heavy order, the garrison commanders were not eager to hop too. Most of those senior commanders in the south were colored, and while they had no love for the whites collectively, on an individual or family level, there were numerous ties of kinship and friendship out there. So while they obeyed orders and started rounding up the whites in their districts, if they came across somebody they knew, well, I won’t chase you if you slip out the back door. And beyond personal connections, there’s a pretty huge gulf between not liking the whites, hating the whites, and then methodically arresting and killing unarmed civilians, including women and children. But with Dessalines on his way to inspect their progress, there were limits to how far the foot dragging could go. So, for example, in Les Cayes, we know that a couple of hundred whites did escape, but those who were unfortunate enough to remain in custody were then systematically murdered. It’s hard to know how many whites were left in Les Cayes after the withdrawal of the French, but at least as many died as got away, and from that point on, the white population of Les Cayes was no more. ",
            "Now, when Dessalines himself got to Les Cayes in late February, he was disappointed by reports of leniency and stalling, and so he took precautions to make sure things would run smoother from here on out. First, Dessalines himself would stick around to supervise, and then, second, he was now going to mostly use nonlocal soldiers to undertake the operation to prevent anybody from like happening across an old playmate and letting them go. Dessalines and his death squad then moved on to Jérémie on February 28, accompanied by a mule train carrying the confiscated property of all the dead whites, because that is obviously a huge part of all this. When Dessalines got to Jérémie, he had all the whites rounded up in the center of town. Then he divided them by profession, moving doctors and any merchant with strong ties to American shipping off to one side and putting the rest in prison. Once they were all locked up, Dessalines then promised to spare anyone who paid a certain protection fee. But this was just a trick to get his intended victims to go dig up any valuables that they may have stashed. Once he was satisfied, he had rung as much cash out of all of them as possible, Dessalines and ordered everyone, including those who had paid protection money, out to the edge of town, where they were methodically bayoneted and decapitated. Apparently, the executioners did not use guns to avoid alerting towns with an earshot of what was happening. When the killing was done, Dessalines learned that a few coloreds had hidden away a few whites. And so Dessalines announced a general amnesty, and when those in hiding came out, he had them arrested and killed, forcing the prominent coloreds to do the killing so they couldn’t later say that they had no blood on their hands. There were about 450 whites left in Jérémie after the withdrawal of the French, and now there were almost none. ",
            "The example of Jérémie then became standard operating procedure for Dessalines’s death squads as they moved through the colony. East along the southern peninsula and then coming up around through Port-au-Prince. They would roll into town, round up the whites, identify anybody worth sparing, demand payment from the rest for clemency, and then kill everyone anyway. Women wore a particularly heavy burden in all this. Once in custody, they were usually raped by Dessalines’s soldiers, and then, after watching their husbands and sons die, be told that they would be spared only if they married a black or colored officer, which is how the black and colored officers would acquire legal title to the lands held by the dead white men. And sometimes not even that was enough. And after being forced to endure all this pain and humiliation, Dessalines would just order all the women killed, too. ",
            "On March 18, Dessalines reached Port-au-Prince, where one of the larger massacres took place. About 800 killed, with only 50 spared. And then he moved up the coast to Arcahaie and Saint-Marc and Gonaïves, killing every white they found. ",
            "But though this was all unfolding with brutal efficiency, we do need to point out a couple of things. First, this was not a popular thing Dessalines was doing. It’s one thing to go in and hack your enemy to death in the heat of battle, or right after storming a town, but not this. Not rounding up civilians and methodically executing them. And so wherever Dessalines went, he came with urgent proclamations, reminding people of the horror done by the French to make everyone okay with this roving genocide that most people were really not okay with. ",
            "Second, there did emerge from all this pretty clear evidence that this was not just about exterminating the white race. This was specifically about the white French. Any white American or British citizen, for example, were always identified and shuffled off to one side and Dessalines went out of his way to tell the Americans, “This has nothing to do with you. I love Americans. We need to keep working together. This is about the French.” Dessalines also spared any Polish soldiers left in the colony. About 5,000 Poles had come over to Haiti over 1802-1803. And a ton of them had promptly defected to the indigenous army. Now, only about 1,200 survived, but of those, almost 500 would permanently settle in Haiti as Haitian citizens. But if you fell into that category of anyone born French whose profane foot soils the land of liberty, you were doomed.",
            "From Gonaïves, Dessalines then moved on to the final stop, Le Cap itself. Now, it too had been renamed after independence with the name that it now bears, going from Le Cap-Français to Le Cap-Haitien. But I’m just going to keep calling it Le Cap. ",
            "Henri Christophe had been put back in charge of the city after the expulsion of the French, and though he had executed a few select whites over the past month or so, that had been mostly about acquiring their property rather than participating in mass murder. But when Dessalines arrived on April 18, that all changed. Over the next few days, thousands were put to death. Depending on what numbers you believe about how many white French were left in the city, the death town is a low of about 1,700 and a high of about 3,000. Depending on various conjectures and guesswork, in total, somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 white French were executed in just about eight weeks. In the summer of 1791, the white population of Saint Domingue had been about 30,000. By the summer of 1804, the white population of independent Haiti was essentially zero. ",
            "The final climax of the genocidal massacres of 1804 was a proclamation issued by Dessalines on April 28 that in many ways marks the end of the Haitian Revolution and the beginning of just the history of independent Haiti. The massacre of the whites represents the last bloody episode in a drama that had been filled with bloody episodes ever since everyone had gone into revolt against everyone else back in 1791. ",
            "Dessalines began by saying, “Finally, the hour of vengeance has struck, and the implacable enemies of the rights of man have received the punishment their crimes deserved.” And then he said, “Yes, we have rendered unto these true cannibals, war for war, crime for crime, outrage for outrage. Yes, I have saved my country. I have avenged America.” ",
            "Now this takes us all the way back to Mercier’s little science fiction fantasy, “The year 2440”, that we talked about way back in Episode 4.2 with that time traveler coming across the statue of the avenger of the New World. Dessalines is now claiming that mantle. And while Dessalines has a lot of statues in Haiti, I don’t think there are any statues of Dessalines in France. ",
            "But this is not all Dessalines had to say. He also said that the bond between the blacks and coloreds was now permanent and that “Blacks and coloreds, you whom the refined duplicity of the Europeans sought so long to divide, who today make up but one family, have no doubt that your perfect reconciliation needed to be sealed with the blood of our executioners.” Which I’m not 100% sure that anybody believed that. The coloreds were not super into any of this and they were already resenting the hell out of Dessalines for making them participate. ",
            "But Dessalines also then laid down the permanent expulsion of the French by announcing that “Never will any colonists or Europeans set foot on this land as a master or proprietor. This resolution will henceforth be the foundation of our Constitution.” And indeed it would be. The Constitution of 1805 was premised on rights and citizenship for the blacks. European whites were not allowed, and it would not be until the American occupation that began in 1915 that white foreigners would be allowed to once again own property in Haiti. So, yes, the proclamation of April 28 does kind of mark the end of the Haitian Revolution. This had all started with the old big whites agitating for home rule and free trade to benefit a small click of wealthy white planters and merchants. And now the whites have not just lost everything, there aren’t even any whites left to have anything. ",
            "In terms of what had been wrought by the revolution, the sad truth is that it was mainly deaf and destruction. As we discussed at the beginning of the series, the population of Saint Domingue on the eve of the revolution was about 30,000 whites, 30,000 colors and 500,000 blacks. So about 560,000 total. A census taken in 1804 revealed the heavy loss of life. There were only about 380,000 people left. Fighting and fleeing had ripped 180,000 souls, roughly one third of the population out of the former colony. The vast majority of those dead were blacks fighting their way out of chains. But you can also bank on somewhere north of 10,000 whites, and probably even more coloreds dying too, as the coloreds were far more active in the military. And none of that counts the dead from the various invading armies, the Spanish and the British and the French, who had all tried and failed to take the colony. ",
            "But beyond the human toll, the material devastation was so vast that it’s nearly impossible to calculate. Obviously, in 1791, Saint Domingue was the most lucrative patch of land on earth. 14 years later, it is a shell of its former self. This is not to lament the death of brutal slave plantations, but it wasn’t just the boiling vats and refining equipment that had been destroyed. The roads, which were never great, were all in a terrible state of disrepair, trashed and broken up by various armies marching to and fro, and just never being repaired. The great plains of the West Province only worked because of extensive irrigation networks that were all now busted up and dry. Every city in the colony had been strafed by bullets and cannonballs and as often as not, the arson’s torch. Port-au-Prince, had almost entirely burned to the ground back in 1791, and since then had been subject to a nearly continuous run of sieges. Le Cap had burned down twice: once in June 1793, and then again in February 1802. And that’s to say nothing of all the other arsons that had accompanied the arrival of the Leclerc Expedition. In terms of basic infrastructure, free and independent Haiti did not have a solid foundation to build on. ",
            "And then, of course, there was what this all meant for Haiti’s relationship with the outside world. Before the revolution, Saint Domingue was, first, France’s most lucrative colony by far, and second, a highly profitable trading partner for both the British and even more importantly, the Americans. But this was all mostly black market thanks to the French exclusive, which is why both the British and Americans made breaking the French exclusive a diplomatic priority. So on the eve of the revolution, the French colony of Saint Domingue was a central focus of three world governments, all vying for its riches. Independent Haiti, meanwhile, is never going to be anyone’s top priority. And indeed, she is about to sink to full pariah status. Right away, for example, no other government in the world recognized Haiti’s independence. They did not recognize Haiti as a sovereign power. Now, at least initially. I think this was mostly because nobody thought independent Haiti was anything but a temporary aberration. Most everyone back in France saw the loss of the colony as short term and it would be recovered later. Most of the old big white establishment, both creole planters and absentee French owners, believed that inevitable, that they would one day be able to return and reclaim their property. And as we’ll see next week, this belief persisted for decades after Haitian independence became a permanent reality. ",
            "But while it’s easy to understand the French not recognizing Haiti, what about the United States and their claim to fame of being the first post-colonial, independent country in the Western Hemisphere? You would think that there would be some impetus to recognizing the second post-colonial, independent country in the Western Hemisphere, but no dice. Thanks to both domestic and international political considerations, the Jefferson administration refused to recognize Haiti. On the domestic front, the rise of Jefferson’s democratic Republicans meant that the voice of the southern planters started to drown out the voice of the northeastern merchants. And if there’s one thing southern planters are never going to support, it’s recognizing a bunch of slave rebels as their equals. And even those northern merchants were not as hot on Haiti as they used to be. There was still money to be made, but it wasn’t the infinite bounty that it had once been. So, yes, the merchants wanted to keep trading, but their voice was not going to overwhelm Jefferson’s diplomatic calculations. ",
            "And then, of course, even more decisive than all of that domestic stuff were those diplomatic calculations. Jefferson wanted to build on his acquisition of Louisiana by acquiring West Florida from the Spanish. That’s the part of Florida that’s not the peninsula. Acquiring West Florida would secure American control over the entire Mississippi River delta. And as he headed towards his second term, Jefferson made Florida one of his top priorities. But since Spain was now a junior partner in Napoleon’s about to be declared French Empire, getting Spain to cede West Florida would only come with French pressure and approval. Since recognizing Haiti would be a major stick to the eye of the French, Jefferson and his Secretary of State James Madison quickly decided that they could not afford to pick up that stick. ",
            "But though they did not offer political recognition, Jefferson and Madison did want to maintain US Merchant access to the island. And perhaps even more importantly, they wanted to maintain the principle that neutral American traders should be allowed to go wherever they wanted. So they told the French, “We do not dispute your sovereign claim. We do not recognize Haitian independence, but our merchants are going to keep trading with them.” And Madison did his best to couch all this as being in France’s best interests. I mean, when you come back, you want to find Saint Domingue still has a functioning economy, right? And even more importantly, you don’t want economic isolation to force the Haitians to fall completely into the orbit of the British, right? I mean, the British might just come in and annex the colony right out from under you. ",
            "But though the British were interested in controlling access to Saint Domingue, they did not have any ambitions to actually take over the colony for themselves. Remember, they had run a five year long occupation that was different from the Leclerc Expedition only in size and scope. Everyone back in London remembered how costly it had been to try to take the colony and how ultimately futile it had turned out to be. So the British were settling on a policy of denying French access to Haiti without bothering to recognize their declared independence. And I think it’s safe to say that all three principal foreign actors, the United States, Britain, and France, (four, if you include Spain) figured that Haitian independence was temporary and that all territorial claims would be worked out at whatever final congress of nations ended this latest war, not realizing that this war was going to go on nonstop for the next decade. ",
            "This all brings us back around to Dessalines’s purge of the white French, because once word of the massacre started leaking out to the British and Americans, any chance that they might have recognized Haiti pretty much went out the window, which means that, in the words of Talleyrand, the massacre of the whites might have been worse than a crime. It might have been a mistake. ",
            "In his April the 28th proclamation, Dessalines dared the world to judge him for the massacres that he had just perpetrated to secure a white free future for Haiti. He said, ",
            "“It is my pride and glory that I admit to it in the face of both mortals and the gods. It matters not how the people of today or of the future will judge me. I have done my duty. I have kept my self esteem, and that is enough for me.” ",
            "So with that in mind, let’s be the judge of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. So it goes without saying that the genocidal massacres perpetrated in the spring of 1804 were a crime, but they also seem to be a huge mistake. The massacres confirmed every single hysterical fear proponents of slavery mustered when they talked about how you can’t let the blacks out of their chains, they will murder us all. And Dessalines had just proved their point in graphic detail. And this was all in contrast, old General Toussaint, who had always been a man the British and Americans could work with. This Dessalines character, on the other hand, seems like a bloodthirsty savage. And so the narrative that built up was that the horror of the massacres of early 1804 turned the Americans and the British away from Haiti and helped cement its future economic and political isolation. ",
            "Then, inside the colony, the massacres both accomplished what Dessalines wanted, but also helped sow the seeds of his own destruction. On a practical level, Dessalines did have every reason to believe that the French would try to come back and that any remaining white inhabitants might be little more than fifth columnists. The racist slavery mentality that had come along with the Leclerc Expedition made it clear what French objectives were and would always be, and so justified from a political and military standpoint, the purge of the whites. But in taking this drastic step, Dessalines put a lot of people on notice, particularly in the colored community, that he was not someone you could ever turn your back on. And so, as the massacre unfolded throughout the colony, many coloreds took the opportunity to try to flee. Once the whites were gone, isn’t Dessalines just going to turn the bayonets on anyone born of a white or related to a white? That’s not a very far leap. And many of the senior colored leaders were also privately seething that Dessalines had forced them to participate in his crimes. ",
            "So what is our historical judgment of Dessalines’s genocidal massacres? They were obviously a heinous crime, but they also appear to have been a mistake that helped isolate Haiti politically and undermined support for Dessalines domestically. ",
            "With the crime committed and the mistake made, Dessalines then set to consolidating power in the summer of 1804, and what he did was essentially recreate the old Louverturian state minus the whites. Export based plantation economics was going to be the only way forward. So even with the final triumph of a black general who happened to be an ex-field slave, all the strict labor codes were kept in place, as were prohibitions on breaking up the states and selling them in smaller lots. So for the mass of rural cultivators out there, things were still just like they had always been. And in this sense, the only real revolutionary difference between 1791 and 1804 was that now blacks and coloreds formed the planter aristocracy rather than whites. ",
            "And just as with the Louverturian state, Dessalines premised his new regime on military rule, for all the same reasons and justifications Toussaint had employed. The military is the only thing standing between the black population and re-enslavement. And besides, who else is going to run things? During Dessalines’s reign, the population of Haiti was essentially living to prop up the military, which he kept at 20,000 strong. And while it did not appear that a new french invasion was imminent, it was clearly inevitable. And so Dessalines spent a lot of time and resources preparing for that inevitable invasion. The experience of the Leclerc Expedition led him to systematize the strategy that had unfolded haphazardly after the arrival of the French in 1802. Dessalines understood that the Haitian army would not be able to hold the port cities against a full invasion supported by a modern European navy, and that it was silly to even try. So he actually dismantled most of the coastal fortification and hauled all the guns and ammunition and material up into the mountains. There, he set everyone to work building a network of forts that would serve as the impenetrable refuge of the army if and when the French never came back. The French would never be able to dislodge the Haitian army from these forts, and all they’d have to do is sit around and wait for our avenging climate to do its work. ",
            "Now, at the time, this all seemed like a justifiable use of labor and resources, but in the end, these forts would not actually be used until the Americans showed up 100 years later, and even then, only very briefly. For the population of Haiti in 1804, they served as nothing more than a drain on labor and resources, and the military became not their protectors, but their oppressors. ",
            "Now, one of the main reasons Dessalines continued to fear reinvasion was that while he had redubbed Saint Domingue Haiti, the old spanish side of the island, Santo Domingo, was still Santo Domingo and still held by the French. An old general named Ferrand had taken over the garrisons at Santo Domingo, and along with troops that had escaped Saint Domingue in the last days of the French occupation and those that had been planted in Santo Domingo the whole time, he now had about 700 men under his command. And as long as he held the east coast of Hispaniola, the French would always be able to land a theoretical reinvasion force without incident. To say nothing of the fact that Ferrand was issuing letters of marque to anyone who wanted one, creating the core of a private tier fleet that would soon be harassing anyone importing to or exporting from Haiti. And Dessalines made an aborted attempt in May 1804, just after the massacres, to capture the city of Santiago with a relatively small expeditionary force. But he captured and then lost, and then captured, and then lost the city and ultimately was forced to retreat and bide his time. ",
            "By the fall of 1804, word had trickled back over to Haiti that back in France, First Consul Bonaparte had rechristened himself Emperor Napoleon I. Possibly to keep up, Dessalines went ahead and held a ceremony in early October 1804 transforming Governor-for-Life Dessalines into Emperor Jacques I of Haiti. With his power and authority now further entrenched, Emperor Jacques made a far more concerted play to capture all of Hispaniola. On February 25, 1805, Emperor Jacques and his Chief Lieutenant Christophe launched a major invasion of the Spanish side of the island, with the emperor leading a column right through the central mountains and Christophe flanking him along the north coast. Their advance was crazy fast, and by March 6, they were at the gates of the city of Santo Domingo. But they had moved so fast that the heavy guns could not keep up. So the Haitian army had to settle in until the guns arrived, with Alexandre Pétion leading the construction of the siege lines. And despite having just 700 regular army soldiers and maybe 2,000 militiamen, the walls of Santo Domingo were high enough and strong enough, the Haitian attacks were easily repulsed. Now, this was all going to change when, on March 26, the guns did show up. But then, the very next day, an even more dramatic arrival upended everything. A small French naval force just so happened to sail into Santo Domingo’s harbor. Now, both because they were sitting ducks for the French guns and because it was possible that this was just the tip of another invasion iceberg, Emperor Jacques pulled up stakes and retreated back to Haiti. ",
            "The future leaders of Haiti would continue to covet control of the whole island, but it would not be until 1822 that Jean-Pierre Boyer finally pulled it off. Just as the Haitian army was marching towards Santo Domingo, the US government was taking its first step towards the economic isolation of Haiti. The French were pressuring the Americans to stop trading with the rebel slaves, and so the Jefferson administration tried to placate the French by passing a law prohibiting arm sales. In November 1804, Congress took up the debate of a bill that ultimately placed heavy restrictions on ships capable of transporting arms traveling to any port in the Western Hemisphere. This bill, called the Clearance Act, was signed into law by Jefferson on March 3, 1805, but it would not be enough to placate the French. Not that petty colonial concerns were really filling much of Napoleon’s attention these days, what with the conquest of Europe to attend to. ",
            "Now, by this point also, it seems that Alexandre Pétion and a small group of officers were already putting together a small conspiracy that would eventually overthrow Emperor Jacques I, a conspiracy that found even more willing adherence when they read the Constitution of 1805, which was unveiled on May 20, 1805. This constitution was like Toussaint’s, a framework for an authoritarian military dictatorship. All power was vested in the emperor, who would be assisted by a small council of state composed of senior generals. The country would be divided into six districts commanded by generals who would be answerable only to the emperor. The constitution also fulfilled Dessalines’s promise that the future of Haiti would be anti white. Article 12 declared, “No white man, regardless of his nationality, may set foot in this territory as a master or landowner, nor will he be able to acquire any property”. But that said, Article 13 then went on to specifically make exemptions for Germans and Poles who had been naturalized by the government. And then Article 14 laid down the principle that because all distinctions of color amongst children of the same family must necessarily stop, Haitians will henceforth only be known generically as blacks. Given the future racial tensions that defined Haitian politics, this was easier to declare than actually embrace. ",
            "But unfortunately for Emperor Jacques specifically and the rest of Haiti generally, they would never be allowed to be the masters of their own destiny, and events beyond the shores of Hispaniola would dictate their history always. 1805 turned out to be an insanely critical year in the Napoleonic Wars, culminating at the end of the year with two battles that would define the nature of the conflict for the next decade. In October, the British smashed the French navy at Trafalgar. And then in December, Napoleon obliterated all comers at Austerlitz. So the French now own the land and the British the seas. ",
            "But now that they own the seas, the British turned decisively against the idea of neutral shipping. They became much rougher in their handling of Americans stopped on the high seas, and then they started in on what became one of America’s great pet peeves in the early 1800s: impressment. This is basically the British claiming that various American sailors are actually British deserters and then forcing them back into British service. Now to be fair, many of these guys were deserters, but it still really annoyed the Americans, and public opinion began to swing away from the British and towards the French. And still hoping to get the French to tell the Spanish to give him Florida, President Jefferson decided to abandon Haiti to its fate. ",
            "At the end of December 1805, Congress began debate on a full economic embargo of Haiti. With the Federalists having been thrashed into oblivion, there was no one left in the Senate to oppose the measure. It cleared the House 93-26 and the Senate 21-7. On February 28, 1806, Jefferson signed into law the act to suspend the commercial intercourse between the United States and certain parts of the island of Santo Domingo. It was meant to last one year, but it would last a lot longer than that. ",
            "So the British were now the only economic link that Haiti had to the rest of the world, and the British were not super interested in helping them out. Mostly, the British now saw the collapse of Haiti as good news, because it boded well for the future economic prospects of Jamaica, who could take over their old sugar business and then strangling the French economically was now a key part of the trade war over the continental system that was fast heating up back in Europe. Haiti needed to export produce to live, and now they had no one to export to. ",
            "None of this did anything but make Emperor Jacques even more unpopular than he already was. His despotic tendencies did not seem to come with any enlightened touch. And in mid 1806, he was announcing that various land titles held by prominent leaders across Haiti were invalid and he would just seize their property. Meanwhile, cultivators were still laboring under restrictive labor codes, except that with economic strangulation setting in, there were very few profits now to make this anything but de facto slavery. And then that same lack of profits was making it impossible for Emperor Jacques to pay his soldiers, who were now also coming to dislike their chief. Discontentment with his regime was now almost uniform, especially down on the Southern Peninsula, the old stronghold of André Rigaud and the men of color. General Pétion and his compatriots were now just waiting for the right moment to strike. But they were careful in their planning, and so made secret contact with Henri Christophe to sound him out. Dessalines and Christophe had been allies for a long time, but that did not make them friends, and Christophe indicated that he would not be ill disposed to the plot. ",
            "In the fall of 1806, Emperor Jacques went on an inspection tour of the South Province. And while down there in Pétion’s backyard, Pétion made his move. Garrison commanders crossed the Peninsula and declared themselves in revolt. The Emperor rushed back towards Port-au-Prince to mobilize a response, but he never made it. At the small town of Pont Rouge, just outside Port-au-Prince Emperor Jacques I was surprised by a company of soldiers and unceremoniously gunned down. According to the story, his body was then torn to pieces by an angry mob. But all the pieces were then gathered back up by a woman, a longtime camp follower of Dessalines going back to the days of the slave revolt. ",
            "When Dessalines died, he was not a popular guy, hence the unceremonious execution and tearing apart of his body. But in due course, Dessalines would become the most prominent and exalted figure of the Haitian Revolution, the man who had finally brought freedom and independence to a nation of black ex-slaves. ",
            "The death of Jean-Jacques Dessalines marks the end of our narrative on the Haitian Revolution. A revolution, as I just said, that began with some big white planters thinking that they were on the verge of self rule and free markets, that they would be the richest kings of the New World, and instead, their slaves had run them right the hell out of town, while fending off and or fighting with the armies of Spain, Britain and France. The Haitian Revolution had unleashed some of the most radically revolutionary forces in history: freedom and equality. It had also seen some of the most atrocious atrocities committed. And in the end, the practical realities of freedom and equality would never live up to the promise. But it is time now for us to move on. ",
            "Next week, I will do my best to wrap things up by plotting a course through the next 200 years of Haitian history, so that you can walk away from all this with some understanding of whatever happened to the avengers of the New World.",

            "Hello, and welcome to Revolutions.",
            "So, last time, we closed the books on the Haitian revolution, which, if you ask me, runs from the Bois-Caïman ceremony in August 1791 through to Dessalines speech, justifying his extermination of the whites in April 1804. I think those two events put handy brackets on the revolution. Now, I did push on through last time to the assassination of Dessalines in the fall of 1906, because the reign of Emperor Jacques I feel like a little interregnum between the revolution per se and just the broader history of Haiti. What I want to do today is complete our cycle of episodes on the Haitian revolution by telling you about that broader history of Haiti. And as you may have noticed, that history has kind of ballooned, your eyes are not deceiving you, this episode really is 1 hour and 40 minutes long, but once I got started, I didn’t want to stop. So here we are. ",
            "Now, unfortunately, while I was clearly having no trouble with my lucidity trying to shoehorn in, long discussions about the Haitian flag never panned out. But if you go to www.revolutionspodcast.com, I have included a ton of images from Haitian history in chronological order along with this episode, including the various modifications to the flag. When I hit upload to this episode, I am then going to go on break to prepare for our next cycle of episodes and also continue to plug away on my forthcoming book, “The Storm Before the Storm, The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic”, which, I should mention, is coming along quite nicely. Revolutions will then return on June 5, 2016, and I hope to see you all on the other side. ",
            "One last thing I’ll mention is that there are going to be a few difficult, obscure names that pop up along the way here, and I’ll probably butcher the pronunciation of at least a few of them, but okay, without further ado, let’s do this thing. ",
            "The assassination of Dessalines was masterminded principally by the colored general Alexandre Pétion and his allies down in the south. But up north in Le Cap, the black general Henri Christophe, offered tacit support for the plot. No one mourned the death of Dessalines, and as soon as his body had been torn to pieces, the conspirators moved quickly onto stage two of their plan: convene a constitutional convention to replace Dessalines short lived empire. Representatives from across the country convened in Port-au-Prince at the end of 1804, and a consensus formed around the creation of a republic led by a president and a senate. The only question was how to divvy up power between the executive and legislative branches. ",
            "Now, though, Pétion was the driving force behind both the overthrow of Dessalines and the subsequent Constitutional Convention. Christophe had more internal political support, especially in the army, and it seemed highly likely that he would be appointed the first president. With this in mind, Pétion’s allies in the convention strengthened the Senate and limited the powers of the presidency. And once the presidency was reduced to a mere figurehead position, Christophe was indeed duly elected the first president of the Republic of Haiti. ",
            "But Christophe wasn’t interested in being merely a figurehead, and setting the tone for the whole rest of Haitian history, he organized his military forces up in the north and sent them marching on Port-au-Prince. In response, Pétion gathered up his own forces to deflect Christophe’s advance, but critically, without cash to pay for his soldiers, Pétion promised land to anyone who would fight for him. But though this looks a lot like the War of Knives, with Christophe acting as Toussaint Louverture and Pétion as André Rigaud, it didn’t actually play out like that. A brief flurry of small scale battles, skirmishes really, led to a stalemate and a divided country. Christophe controlled the northern regions as far south as Saint-Marc, including the interior plains of the West Province. Pétion controlled Port-au-Prince and the entire Southern Peninsula. And this divided state of affairs would persist for the next 13 years. And seen through the lens of traditional racial politics, Christophe represents a black regime, and Pétion represents a colored regime. But the reality, as usual, is a bit murkier than all of that. ",
            "So up in the north, President Christophe settled in to continue the basic line that ran from the Louverturian state through to Dessalines’s short lived empire: authoritarian military rule, and an export based plantation economy. As with Toussaint and Dessalines, Christophe also poured a ton of his revenue into national defense, and he built these palatial fortresses that came to symbolize his reign. To build these palaces, Christophe actually resorted to coerced labor, with reports of men and women literally in chains, working under armed guard. But Christophe was not just a strong man, and in terms of political vision, he far exceeded Dessalines and even came to approach old Papa Toussaint himself. ",
            "After four years as merely president, Christophe decided to move up in the world. And in 1811, he had himself crowned King Henry I of the Kingdom of Haiti. And then he formed a little feudal aristocracy to support his regime, with dukes and counts and barons, all with coats of arms and family crests, the whole nine yards. This new nobility was drawn from both black and colored military officers. And since plantation economics was the foundation of Christoph’s regime, these guys wound up owning the major plantations. To govern the relationships of his subjects, the king also issued the massive Code Henri – a hyper detailed law book that ran something like 800 pages. And it was in a lot of ways, a return to the old Code Noir issued by Louis XIV. Mostly the poor workers were there to work, and as usual, were bound to their plantations, like the serfs that they now basically were. But it also included rights for those workers and requirements that the landholding aristocracy provide for the cultivators and restrict abuses of them. King Henri also reached out to other world leaders seeking political recognition for his regime, but he found no takers, though he did enter into a very fruitful correspondence with the British abolitionists Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce. Clarkson in particular, lobbied for the Haitians in London, and helped King Henri set up schools to educate the next generation of Haitians: the first generation of Haitians who would be born free. ",
            "Meanwhile, down in the south, Pétion was himself sworn in as president of the rival Republic of Haiti in March 1807. And for the first time, a new economic system started to replace the old plantation model. Having promised land to the men who fought for him in the brief civil war with Christophe, Pétion had to make good on those promises, which meant breaking up some of the bigger estates. When this started happening, the whole plantation system of the all powerful owner driving powerless cultivators began to break down. Even on larger estates, a system emerged called métayage, where tenant farmers were left to work the land with little oversight, and they would then split the produce 50/50 with the owner. And these days, the principal crop we’re talking about is coffee. ",
            "Pétion also introduced another innovation that would soon become a core part of the Haitian political economy. He took the old tax system where agents went round to each plantation to collect 25% of the estate’s produce and replaced it with a new system of customs duties collected in the port cities. These new import-export taxes were far easier to collect and manage, and soon they would become the tax base for all future Haitian governments. ",
            "But as some measure of decentralized egalitarianism took root economically, Pétion could not resist the pull to political authoritarianism. It was one thing to make the presidency a figurehead when your arrival is about to become president, quite another when you are now president. So, bit by bit, power moved from the Senate to the president. In 1810, Pétion was reelected, and then in 1816, the de facto autocracy was codified by a new constitution. ",
            "But rhetorically, Pétion still promised a government by and for the people. So the presidency and Senate were now joined by a chamber of deputies, who were elected by universal manhood suffrage, which is a pretty big deal. But the chamber had no actual power. The president proposed laws and nominated all the senators, and they in turn, ratified the president’s wishes. Also, the presidency is now for life, and he has the right to nominate his successor. ",
            "Meanwhile, the rest of the world was busy not recognizing any of this. For roughly the same reason, neither Britain nor the United States would recognize the Kingdom of Haiti or the Republic of Haiti. It simply set a bad example to treat ex-slaves and coloreds as political equals. Now, Britain, of course, had taken the momentous step of outlawing the slave trade in 1807, but to be honest, that was mostly tied to their trade war with Napoleon’s continental system, and slavery continued in all of their colonies for another 30 years. And the Americans were 100% not going to recognize the ex-slaves running Haiti. So political recognition would not be coming from either power anytime soon. ",
            "But that said, when Napoleon did not force the Spanish to give the Americans Florida, the American embargo on Haiti ended in 1810, and American merchants once again traded with the island. But without diplomatic relations both Haitian and American merchants were living in a weird limbo. But it would be an overstatement to say that after independence, Haiti was just economically cut off from the rest of the world. They really weren’t. ",
            "As Britain and the United States dragged their feet over recognition, Napoleonic France refused to even consider the issue until just before the fall of Napoleon. A few of the old big white families had ensconced themselves inside the imperial government, and they were still looking to regain what they had lost. But with a military operation to retake the colony looking like a pipe dream, the old planters were ready to settle for compensation for the land and the property and the human beings that they claimed to have lost. ",
            "So, in the twilight of Napoleon’s empire, envoys from France arrived in Haiti in 1814 to talk about a deal. They went first to the Republic of Haiti and met with Pétion, who first made it crystal clear that Haiti was going to forever be free and independent. But he also suggested that in return for political recognition, the Haitians might be willing to offer restitution to the ruined French planters. Encouraged, these envoys then moved on to the Kingdom of Haiti, where they received a very different welcome from King Henri. Suspecting correctly, French duplicity, the king arrested one of the envoys, discovered secret instructions that basically said, try to make allies with the colored so they can help us re-enslave the blacks and Christophe had the envoy executed. ",
            "Now, under normal circumstances, this would have been hugely provocative, but, of course, by then, major events had overtaken Europe. Napoleon was defeated and redefeated and then sent off to St. Helena to regret ever sending the Leclerc Expedition to Saint Domingue. At the post Napoleonic Congress of Vienna, French and British agents made themselves a little side deal. If France didn’t interfere with British traders in Haiti, the British would not stand in the way of any future attempt by the French to reclaim their colony. But since the restored Bourbons had no desire or ability to retake the colony by force, they resorted to old Ancien Régime methods of flattery and bribery. In 1816, new French envoys arrived bearing presents. Twelve crosses for the Legion of Honor and ten for the order of Saint-Louis, to be divided between President Pétion, King Henri, and their political inner circles. In exchange for these great and distinguished honors, the Haitians would make themselves a French protectorate – internally autonomous, but with France dictating foreign affairs. Both President Pétion and King Henri sent this insulting offer packing. They were not going to sell their souls for a fancy metal. ",
            "So the rest of the world continued to not recognize independent Haiti, even after it suddenly unified and then conquered all of Hispaniola in the span of just a few years. In 1818, President Pétion died and was succeeded by his longtime ally, Jean-Pierre Boyer. ",
            "Boyer carried on as president of the Republic of Haiti until surprising news came down from the Kingdom of Haiti. In August 1820, King Henri had a stroke, and in his weakened state, opportunistic officers decided to organize a coup to overthrow him. They railed against the micromanaged tyranny of the Code Henri and promised 10,000 unicorns to anyone who joined them overthrow the despotic king. A general insurrection erupted, and Christophe was soon cornered and isolated in his palace. On October 8, 1820, King Henri I shot himself in the heart. ",
            "Now, it’s hard to tell what, if any, part Boyer played in this uprising, but one thing we do know is that Boyer took advantage of the situation, advanced north, and reunified the country without firing a shot. That the armed forces of the kingdom of Haiti acquiesced so quickly does kind of scream shenanigans. By 1821, the Kingdom of Haiti was erased from the map, and all Haiti was now the Republic of Haiti. ",
            "But Boyer was not done there. In November 1821, the inhabitants of Santo Domingo, who had kicked out the last of the French in 1809 and then subsequently brought back into the Spanish Empire, emulated all the Latin American leaders that we’re going to talk about in our next series, and declared independence from Spain. They asked Boyer for aid and support, and he said, “Yes, I will do it!”, marched over and annexed the entire island. And just like that, Boyer’s Republic of Haiti covered all of Hispaniola. ",
            "But there was still this problem that despite the fact that all of Hispaniola was now under his control, no other power recognized Boyer’s government. And for the record, we’re now 20 years removed from Dessalines’s 1804 Declaration of Independence. After taking over Hispaniola, Boyer wrote to the Monroe administration in 1822 asking for recognition, but the letter was not even opened because the American government couldn’t risk the appearance of recognition. Then, in response to the run of Declarations of Independence in Spanish America, that we’re going to talk about in our next series, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams crafted the famous Monroe Doctrine, which made it US. Policy to oppose European interference with independent nations in the Western Hemisphere. But Haiti was pointedly excluded from this formulation because the United States did not recognize their independence. If France wanted to come back, the Monroe Doctrine was not going to stand in their way. ",
            "But by the mid-1820s, France had totally abandoned the idea of ever trying to retake the island, and they now focused on trying to squeeze monetary restitution out of the Haitians for lost French property. And in 1825, King Charles X, the old comte d’Artois, decided to settle things once and for all. Another batch of French envoys arrived in Port-au-Prince to offer a deal: political recognition in exchange for cold, hard cash. ",
            "Now, the diplomacy of all this had to go through some absurd gymnastic twists. Since France couldn’t recognize Boyer as president of Haiti, because the French did not recognize Boyer as the president of Haiti, Charles X’s lawyers had to dream up a pretty insulting diplomatic formula. The King would issue a royal decree to what they were now calling the French part of Saint Domingue. This decree had three points. ",
            "First, the French part of Saint Domingue would be allowed free commerce with the world, but in the future, France would enjoy a 50% discount on tariffs. Second, the inhabitants of the French part of Saint Domingue would pay 150,000,000 francs over five installments to compensate French planters for their losses. And third, France would then concede that the current inhabitants of the French part of Saint Domingue enjoyed full and complete independence. ",
            "Now, no one has any idea where the 150,000,000 comes from. It was just a really big made up number, it’s not like they were sitting around looking at receipts or anything, but for sure, it included lost slave value, which is pretty damned insulting. I mean, the French lost their slaves because those slaves rose up and overthrew them. Then the French had come back, tried to re-enslave all their slaves, and they got beat again. And now the French don’t even want to risk another military expedition, but they still expect the Haitians to, in effect, pay for the freedom that they had already purchased with their blood.",
            "But Boyer was in a mighty dilemma, because the French had a navy and he did not. And while an actual reinvasion was not likely, the envoys made it very clear that if the Haitians did not accept the deal, it would be economically blockaded, and the Haitians would not be able to break that blockade. ",
            "But even still, Boyer gave this royal decree to a small commission of advisers, and they came back and said, you should reject this, It’s an abomination. So Haiti almost called the French bluff. But in a private meeting between Boyer and the lead French envoy, the Haitian president personally agreed to the deal. His hope was that diplomatic recognition would open up the markets of the world to Haitian exports, bring in modern expertise, technology, maybe investment, and that any indemnity that had been paid would be made insignificant by the resulting economic boom. So he said, okay. His compliant Senate duly ratified the agreement, but the public was never told the terms. All Boyer said publicly was that the French came to recognize us. And this triggered a wave of parties across the island. It wasn’t until months later that newspapers arrived from France with all the details, and the general population, at least the literate population, was outraged. Boyer had just agreed to pay for the independence that they had already won. ",
            "And the indemnity itself turned out to not even be the worst of it, because obviously, the Haitian government does not have 30 million francs sitting around to make the first payment. It would be due at the end of 1825. So the French envoys very helpfully arranged a loan from French banks to cover the initial installment, a 30 million franc loan over 25 years at 6% interest, with a whopping 20% service fee. From that moment on, Haiti was crushed under this double debt of first the indemnity itself and then servicing the loans to pay for it. And right away, this ate up 30% of the annual budget, and with another 50% going to prop up the military, that left only 20% for everything else. But though the French now sent an official agent to represent them, it would not be until 1838 that full and complete political recognition would be acknowledged, which happened to coincide with Boyer negotiating the remaining 120 franc indemnity down to 60 million. But even still, in 1825, Haiti was now on the map, and every other European power followed the French by sending envoys to represent them. But not the United States. Still not the United States. ",
            "Recognition purchased, Boyer then settled into what turned out to be a fairly stable authoritarian regime. I mean, remarkably stable. He would stay in power until 1843. And though it had a few democratic trappings – the chamber of deputies still existed, the Republic of Haiti was a dictatorship. But Boyer focused that dictatorship mostly on the urban areas, and he kind of left rural Haiti to its own devices. The model of sharecropping developed by Pétion had migrated out of the Southern Peninsula when Boyer absorbed the Kingdom of Haiti, and Henri Christophe turned out to be the last leader to keep large estate plantations as the economic norm, at least until the Americans arrived in 1915. ",
            "So even the lucrative Northern Plains were slowly divided up among smaller holders. And by now, sugar, the commodity that had once been synonymous with Saint Domingue, had all but disappeared. What sugar was grown was very small scale and for local conversion into molasses or rum. So there are no more piles of white gold sitting on the docks of Le Cap. And as the economy decentralized, models of family ownership began to take root. Called Lakou, hopefully I’m pronouncing that right, the system was built on extended families collectively owning and controlling land where they grew a mix of export crops, internal market commodities, and then just their own food. Boyer made a feeble attempt to retain some of the old authoritarian labor codes by promulgating a Code Rural in 1826 that severely limited the rights of workers and empowered landowners. But it was nearly impossible to enforce. And Boyer spent no time, capital, or resources trying to enforce it. ",
            "And one of the reasons it was so hard to enforce the code was that the urban/rural cultural divide was mirrored by the army. Like all its predecessors, the Republic of Haiti was administered by the military, but the military apparatus was not as unified or centralized as it might have appeared from the outside. Senior officers ran districts practically as autonomous fiefdoms, with appointments that could last for decades. The national government in Port-au-Prince wasn’t strong enough to reign these guys in, so a balance emerged between the main urban areas and the interior rural districts. The national government, such as it was, focused its limited resources entirely on the urban areas and especially on trying to boost trade, since the government now relied entirely on export/import taxes to generate revenue. Boyer encouraged foreign merchants to settle in the principal cities of Le Cap and Port-au-Prince and Les Cayes to help Haitian exports reach the world. Most of these merchants turned out to be Germans, who would then marry a Haitian woman to get around the no foreign ownership clause in the Constitution, and then dug themselves in to act as gatekeepers between Haiti and the world’s economy. ",
            "As the years went by, the autocratic nature of Boyer’s government, the humiliating indemnity, the rising power of these foreign German merchants helped erode support for his regime. Opposition grew primarily in a new generation of young, educated professionals in the cities. This new generation had been born free in independent Haiti, and they were frankly tired of listening to old veterans of the revolution justify their petty despotism with appeals to service records now 40 years old. These educated young professionals, most of them drawn from the elite colored families, spoke and read French rather than Creole, and were plugged into current European thinking. They demanded greater democratic access, national self assertion, and a modern economy. ",
            "The rise of these young liberals culminated in 1842, which just so happened to follow a massive earthquake hitting Le Cap that killed something like half the population of the city. And Boyer blundered politically by not even bothering to visit the destroyed city. Aware that opposition to his rule was rising, Boyer tried to curb the influence of the younger generation, but he failed. The reformist liberals won a majority in the Chamber of Deputies in the election of 1842. And while that Chamber was basically powerless, it still might serve as a platform for further attacks on the Boyer regime. So, taking a queue from old Oliver Cromwell, Boyer posted soldiers at the door of the Chamber with a list of names. Only those named strong Boyer allies were to be admitted into the Chamber. ",
            "But this only emboldened the liberal opposition. Now gathering down in Les Cayes, the young activists held meetings to denounce Boyer in the authoritarian constitution of 1816, and they started to plot a real revolt. In January 1843, an insurrection erupted from Les Cayes, led by a pair of cousins, a senior military officer named Charles Rivière Hérard and his intellectual civilian cousin, Hérard Dumesle. And these are, for example, the obscure names that I’m probably butchering. ",
            "With a group of armed supporters, these guys all marched over to Jérémie and found themselves welcomed not just by the town, but by the military garrison. Boyer sent troops to contain the uprising, but they, too, defected to the rebels when they arrived. And back in Port-au-Prince, Boyer himself was harassed by a mob of angry women who heckled him if he ever showed his face in public. After 25 years in power, it took maybe two months of armed insurrection to oust Boyer, and he abdicated the presidency in March of 1843. In what would become a time honored tradition for Haitian presidents, Boyer boarded a boat to Kingston, Jamaica. From there, he moved on to Paris, where he died in exile in 1850. He was the last of the men who had sat at the table to celebrate the ceasefire with Leclerc in the spring of 1802, and it was time for a new generation to take over. ",
            "The revolution of 1843 could have marked a huge point of departure for Haiti. The displacement of the aging revolutionary generation by young men born free. Democracy replacing dictatorship. Civilian rule replacing military rule. But it was not to be. I mean, it started out great. The revolutionary liberals held a constitutional convention in Port-au-Prince that was open to the public, and there crafted a very liberal constitution which guaranteed the right to political assembly, trial by jury, and direct election of senators, and for the first time, direct election of the president, who would be selected by an electoral college style system of delegates. They also maintained the ban on foreign ownership of property, which they still viewed as essential to maintaining national sovereignty. But voting was also going to be limited to property owners and professionals, which seemed good and right to these young urban liberals, but effectively cut out the vast majority of the population from political participation. The new constitution was finished by the end of the year, and in December 1843, Charles Rivière Hérard became president of a regenerated Republic of Haiti. But things quickly went awry. ",
            "With the convulsions rocking the French side of Hispaniola, the Spanish side of the island spied an opportunity, and in February 1844, they rebelled against 20 years of Haitian rule. So shortly after his inauguration, President Hérard had to march east to try to keep control of the whole island. But his ensuing campaign was a complete failure. He was unable to get a hold of the situation and was forced into retreat. Santo Domingo declared independence in May 1844, and while they would be ruled by many regimes and multiple countries over the next 150 years, they would never again be ruled by the Haitians. ",
            "While he was off on this campaign, the President left his cousin Hérard Dumesle in charge of Port-au-Prince, and it quickly became clear to everyone that the Hérards were discovering the efficacy of authoritarian rule. I mean, it is easier to just crush your enemies rather than negotiate with them. So by the time the president returned from his embarrassing campaigns in Santo Domingo, both cousins were wildly unpopular, both with liberal idealists and the establishment military, who resented the attempt by all these young civilians to push the old military aside. ",
            "And then they got really whacked in the side of the head. A peasant uprising began as soon as the new constitution was promulgated in December 1843. The liberal revolutionaries had enjoyed support from the rural peasants when they overthrew Boyer, but now those peasants found themselves all but cut out of the deal. So a prominent black farmer down on the Southern Peninsula named Louis-Jean-Jacques Acaau started gathering an army of angry rural workers. He denounced the old colored elites and said, “We need to push those guys off the island and divvy up all the land for ourselves.” And there’s a story here, that during one of these speeches, black members of the audience started eyeing a light skin colored worker in their midst. But Acaau said, “No, no, if he’s a poor, illiterate worker who speaks Creole then he’s black like us, and if any rich, educated, French speaking black is down in the city, he’s a mulatto.” ",
            "So this again fits with a lot of what we’ve seen. Skin color is very important to Haitian politics, but it’s always augmented by social and class distinctions. ",
            "By the spring of 1844, Acaau’s army was on the move. These armed peasants were dubbed the Piquets, after the long sharpened pickets that they carried in battle. Allegedly, they were all dipped in poison. The Piquets followed almost the same line that the liberal revolutionaries had, marching from the plains around Les Cayes towards Port-au-Prince. And while they marched, a completely separate military insurrection then began in the north, and the short lived Hérard government became, well, the short lived Hérard government. Rivière Hérard abdicated the presidency in May 1844, and shortly thereafter, both he and his cousin got on the boat to Kingston. Because the motto for all ambitious Haitian leaders is: Today Port-au-Prince, tomorrow Kingston. ",
            "A more conservative group of old Boyer ministers and military officers came together after the expulsion of the Hérards to try to regain power. But recognizing that poor black hatred of the colored elites was a thing. They tried to mollify that hatred by digging up an old black veteran of the revolution, whose name I won’t trouble you with, to be president. After this guy served the year as mere figurehead, he died and was replaced with a near clone, a guy named Jean-Louis Pierrot, who had once been a prince in King Henri’s nobility. Now, Pierrot did exercise some initiative, and he promoted Acaau to a senior post in the military and gave the peasant leader political power back in his home region surrounding Les Cayes. But this ticked off the colored puppet masters, who then staged a little uprising outside Port-au-Prince in 1846, forcing Pierrot to abdicate in favor of another old black general whose name I also won’t trouble you with. After the overthrow of his benefactor, Acaau went back into revolt. But this time, the military was far more unified. The latest uprising failed, and Acaau committed suicide. ",
            "After the death of Acaau, the clique of military commanders and old Boyer loyalists thought that they now had a firm grip on things. They inaugurated a new constitution in 1846 that essentially revived Pétion’s authoritarian constitution, with, for example, the Senate appointing the president again. And then in 1847, the colored elite dominated Senate went round and found another old black general named Faustin Soulouque to serve as president. But here, things went off the rails. Soulouque seemed like kind of an amiable dullard, but he also happened to be the head of the elite Presidential Guard. And when he became president in early 1847, Soulouque cut the strings of the puppet masters. With the help of the loyal Presidential Guard, the new president deployed the authoritarian powers granted to him by the constitution and purged the Senate of the very men who had just elevated him. Then, in the spring of 1848, he straight up executed a cohort of elite colored leaders identified as powerful threats to his rule. Having effectively neutralized the coloreds, in August 1949, President Soulouque had himself declared Emperor Faustin I of Haiti and then proceeded to create a Christophe style nobility to help him rule the country, draping his new empire in a blend of African and European imagery. And most famously, or perhaps most infamously, Emperor Faustin embraced Voodoo, the religion of the rural blacks that had always been looked down on by the more urbane colored elite. Soulouque was supposed to have been a pliable old man, and instead, he ruled Haiti with an iron fist for the next decade. ",
            "But despite his imperial pretensions, Emperor Faustin failed in his one major foreign policy objective to retake Santo Domingo, which was now calling itself the Dominican Republic. He launched a string of military campaigns against old Santo Domingo, but by now, the Haitian military was basically good at maintaining domestic power, but very bad at actually fighting a war. They were not very well trained or equipped, and they got beat every time they marched east. ",
            "After a decade in the political wilderness, the light skinned coloreds finally organized enough resistance to make a move against Emperor Faustin. They rallied behind General Fabre Geffrard, who staged a coup in 1859 and exiled Emperor Faustin to, you guessed it, Kingston, Jamaica. Geffrard then dismantled the imperial apparatus and returned Haiti to a Pétion-Boyer style republic run by the educated urban coloreds, pointedly making a major push to outlaw Voodoo completely, which he saw as backwards and an obstacle to Haiti being taken seriously by the rest of the world. ",
            "But Geffrard’s move back towards this vision of modern respectability had nothing to do with the United States finally deciding to extend political recognition to independent Haiti, which they finally did do during Geffrard’s presidency. Because just after Geffrard sees power, the United States entered into a murder suicide pact with itself and launched the Civil War in 1861. With all the southern delegates having quit the Union, there was no one left in Congress to oppose recognition of Haiti. And so in 1862, the abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner induced Lincoln’s state department to go ahead and recognize the Republic of Haiti on June 5 1862, just about 58 years after the French had withdrawn and the Haitians first declared independence. So Haiti was now recognized by everyone.  ",
            "Back in the now truly recognized Republic of Haiti, President Geffrard continued Emperor Faustin’s policy of trying to bring the Dominican Republic back under Haitian control, but he, too, was unsuccessful. In 1861, a group of old Spanish loyalists seized power and voted themselves back into the Spanish empire. But this turned out to be super short lived, and in 1865, a rival faction seized power and once again declared themselves the independent Dominican Republic. Not that Haiti was in much of a position to take advantage of all this. Geffrard spent most of his presidency fending off various coups and insurrections launched by regional commanders. ",
            "In 1865, one of these insurrections actually got some traction. Led by an officer in the north, a Major named Sylvain Salnav, the insurrection was bad enough that Geffrard had to talk the Royal Navy into helping him quash it. The British sailed a couple of ships along the coast and lobbed some cannonballs at Salnav’s position. Salnav responded then by openly appealing to the United States for help, even going so far as to offer them the great naval port of Môle-Saint-Nicolas in exchange for their aid. But the United States rejected the offer, something they would not have done just a few years later. But Salnav won his war with Geffrard anyway. And after eight years in power, President Geffrard got on the boat to Kingston in 1867. Salnav, though, he never made it to Kingston. Two years later, opponents of his new regime shelled the presidential palace, lighting up a stockpile of gunpowder, blowing the place all to hell and killing Salnav in the process. ",
            "Now, following the death of Salnav is one of the most mind blowing things to ever happen in the history of Haitian politics: the Senate elected a General named Nissage Saget president in 1869. President Saget served out his full term and retired peacefully in 1874. Mind blowing, I know. ",
            "After that, it was back to the funhouse. By the second half of the 19th century, though, there was a degree of unity amongst some of these political factions. Now, for sure, the overriding principle was military officers using regional power bases to pounce on Port-au-Prince , take it, and then later get pounced on and exit stage left to Kingston. But two broad political worldviews did start to organize themselves, and both in fairly explicit racial terms. On the one hand, there was the Nationalist Party. These guys were primarily blacks, and they drew their support from the rural workers. The nationalists were avowedly populist and ran in opposition to the colored elites of the cities. Opposing them was the Liberal Party, who were drawn from those colored elites. They were centered in the cities, they were professional and educated and spoke French and were cosmopolitan. Their motto was literally “Government by the most competent”. They believe the vast majority of the population, which was now about 700,000, was simply unfit to participate in government. But one of the biggest things that these guys fought over was, how do we position ourselves as a very small, weak country in a world of giant predators? ",
            "Now, even as late as the 1870s, Haiti continued to have very strong cultural and economic ties to France. Now, the German merchants, of course, continued to play an outsized role in Haitian economics, but fully 50% of Haitian imports still came from France. All the elites spoke French and took their intellectual and cultural cues from the French, to say nothing of the fact that a huge chunk of Haitian tax revenue was shipped back to Paris every year. And if you can believe it, the burden of debt only got worse after the 1825 indemnity was finally paid off. To make the last payment, the Haitian government contracted a huge loan from the French in 1875. And then in 1876, they took out an even bigger loan just to handle the servicing on the loan from 1875. So the last indemnity payment was finally made in 1883. But by then, the Haitian debt had nearly tripled. And those were just the big long term loans. With so much of the government’s tax revenue going to pay off the long term debts, various Haitian governments had to contract short term debt just to pay annual expenses. The international banking community, they loved this. They just kicked back and collected high interest rates and fees that the Haitians, to their credit, no pun intended, assiduously, paid back, even if it left them almost nothing to spend in Haiti itself. ",
            "But to protect their various investments, the European bankers were not just going to sit back and hope for the best. And at various points in the late 19th century, the Germans, French and Americans all floated gunships in and around Haiti to intimidate the Haitians into making sure they paid their debts. And then, in 1880, the French essentially seized control of Haiti’s national finances when they incorporated the National Bank of Haiti. This bank would serve as the depository of tax receipts. It would print all Haitian currency and issue all personal and commercial loans. And this bank was wholly owned and operated by the French. If I’ve read my sources right, Haiti’s currency wasn’t even printed in Haiti. It was printed in France and then shipped across the Atlantic. ",
            "The guy who orchestrated the creation of the bank was a modernizing black nationalist named Lysius Salomon. Salomon was a member of the very small black elite in Haiti, as opposed to the colored elite. And he had been a minister under Emperor Faustin and was then exiled after the collapse of the empire in 1859. But rather than taking the boat to Kingston and just sitting there, Salomon spent his exile in London and Paris. And when he came home 20 years later, he was full of ideas. Salomon seized the government in 1879 in the midst of factional street fighting in Port-au-Prince, and then ruled from 1879 to 1888. During his reign, he focused on trying to bring Haiti up to modern standards, and he embarked on a bunch of reforms. He focused on improving education and public administration and the internal infrastructure of the country. And it was under his auspices that the National Bank of Haiti was established to stabilize and he hoped to protect Haiti’s finances. ",
            "But the establishment of the National Bank of Haiti in many ways marks the end of French predominance. They would continue to run the bank, but by now, the United States of America was looming very large in the Western Hemisphere. The Americans had been refusing to get too involved in Caribbean affairs after the Civil War, declining as we saw Salnav’s offer to hand over Môle-Saint-Nicolas. And then they followed this up by declining the Dominican Republic’s offer in 1869 to just be annexed into the United States in exchange for financial relief. As late as the 1880s, the Americans were still rejecting offers to get too directly involved in Haiti. In 1883, Salomon tried to entice American investment and concessions by offering the American Navy either Môle-Saint-Nicolas or Tortuga. Take your pick. But the Americans again declined. ",
            "But American reticence to get actively involved in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere was fast disappearing by the end of the 1880s. In 1888, a revolt toppled President Salomon. Though being the man of the world that he was, Salomon headed for Paris rather than Kingston to spend his exile, though he did die just a few months later. A new government briefly held power. But then they were overthrown by another general who had gone into revolt named Florvil Hyppolite. And it was the arrival of Hyppolite that marks the beginning of a more aggressive American posture towards Haiti, because General Hyppolite’s revolt was armed and supplied by the Americans, to whom he had made a number of promises. ",
            "This more active participation in Haiti was a part of a much wider American reinterpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. Now, the Monroe Doctrine was essentially defensive in nature, right? The United States would stand between Europe and the Americas. Well, new internationalist minded Secretary of State James Blaine entered office in 1889 and brought with him the Big Brother policy, which sought to bring the nations of the Western Hemisphere together under the auspices of American political and business leadership. This shift from passive to active leadership would then culminate with the Roosevelt Corollary in 1904, which we’ll talk about here in a minute. ",
            "Now, mostly, this new click of internationalist minded Americans were hot to pry Cuba and Puerto Rico away from Spain. But in Haiti, this shift in focus meant the United States was now ready to say yes to repeated Haitian offers to take Môle-Saint-Nicolas. Except now the Hyppolite government didn’t want to do it. The Americans claim that Hyppolite had specifically promised the port in return for aid in his revolt and that he was now reneging on the deal. But the new Haitian foreign Minister, Antenor Firmin, who also happens to be one of the greatest intellectual and political forces in the history of the Caribbean (but let’s not get sidetracked), denied the promise had ever been made. To negotiate for the Americans, President Benjamin Harrison and Secretary of State Blaine decided to send Frederick Douglass, who also happens to be one of the greatest intellectual and political forces in the history of the United States (but let’s not get sidetracked on that either). Off and on from 1889 to 1891, Douglass and Firmin tried to work out a deal that would be acceptable to both sides. But American business interests soon became disenchanted with Douglass’s willingness to see the Haitian side of things. And they pressured the Harrison administration to send somebody tougher. So the Americans pushed Douglass aside and sent an admiral in the US Navy to take over. But the harder line just made the Haitians more resistant. So the admiral played what he thought would be his trump card: he steamed four gunships into the harbor of Port-au-Prince and basically said, “Give us Môle-Saint-Nicolas or I start firing”. But incredibly, Firmin came back and said, “No, do your worst.” Firmin had numerous contacts in the American business and political community, and he had it on very good authority that the ships were there to look tough but not fire, and that it was safe to call the bluff. So he called the bluff, and after lingering for a few days, the admiral finally pulled out in a huff in April 1891. ",
            "Now, through all of these years, the tension between rural Haiti and urban Haiti and the political center of Port-au-Prince and the various regional districts continued. And every national government fought off various coups and insurrections from all sides, usually until one of them finally succeeded and the process would repeat. And it was during the reign of President Salomon that a semi-permanent name was attached to the various rural rebels who would rise up in support of some local leader. They were called the Cacos. I hope I am pronouncing that right, C-A-C-O. ",
            "The Cacos were a type of fighter rather than an ideological or political force per se. An ambitious military officer serving in some particular district would raise the local Cacos to fight for him, always, always promising 10,000 unicorns if he won. But of course, if he did win, he would leave the royal Caco fighters behind and forget all about the promises he had made. And it was while riding a horse on his way to deal with one of these uprisings, that President Hyppolite had a heart attack and died in 1896. He was succeeded by his secretary of war, who survived long enough to actually reach the end of his constitutional term limit in 1902. This guy tried to stay in power, but he was forced out of office by other ambitious leaders who wanted the job. ",
            "But not unlike 1843, the resulting political crisis of 1902 brought with it a cohort of young reformist liberals who wanted their hero, Antenor Firmin, to be president. In the wake of the president’s resignation in 1902, a movement started up to take appointment of the president away from the Senate and make it an actual democratically elected office. And this movement got enough traction that a convention was called in Port-au-Prince to decide how to proceed. And this convention decided on an American style electoral type election system, open to men who met certain economic requirements. But a senior clique of military officers who wanted no part of the intellectual civilian Firmin instead organized themselves behind the positively ancient general named Pierre Nord Alexis. Alexis was 82 years old. He had been born way back in 1820 and just so happened to be the illegitimate grandson of Henri Christophe. ",
            "Street fighting soon broke out between soldiers and the young liberals, and when the election was finally held in June 1902, the military deployed itself in force all around the polling stations to maintain order. With the election clearly being stolen out from under them, Firmin’s partisans armed and fought back. But Firmin was not a general, and his partisans were not soldiers. Not helping the cause was the fact that both the Americans and Germans supported Alexis, who was prepared to make the kind of international concessions Firmin had refused just a few years earlier. ",
            "In one famous incident, a small warship run by one of Firmin’s supporters called the Crête-à-Pierrot, (That name ring a bell? Good!), was identified by Alexis to the Germans as a pirate vessel, and the German navy attacked the ship. Totally overmatched, rather than be taken alive, the captain of the Crête-à-Pierrot blew it up, which is kind of a nice metaphor for the whole tradition of liberal reform in Haiti. Alexis became president, and Firmin was driven into exile, though he went to St. Thomas rather than Kingston, and there he died in 1911. ",
            "Now, by the time that General Alexis became President Alexis, the whole Western Hemisphere was already wrestling with the fact that a hyperactive aristocratic cowboy polymath wielding the biggest stick in the world had just moved into the White House. Because on September 14, 1901, William McKinley had died and Theodore Roosevelt became president of the United States. Roosevelt, as I’m sure you know, was an enthusiastic booster of American imperialism and had already helped trigger the Spanish American war that transferred the last bits of the Spanish empire into American hands. In 1904, Roosevelt codified a new approach to Pan American politics when a financial and political crisis erupted in the Dominican Republic. The Dominicans were about to default to like the whole world, and the French, Germans, Italians and Dutch were all individually one missed payment away from invading and occupying the country to guarantee Dominican repayment of debt. Roosevelt said “No, that would be a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. But here’s what we’re going to do. The United States will invade and occupy the country, and we will guarantee Dominican repayment of debt.” Whereupon the marines invaded and occupied the Dominican Republic. To guarantee repayment of the Dominican debt, the marines took over supervision of their custom houses and all banking operations. This new approach to Pan American politics is called the Roosevelt Corollary. The position that the US will not just defend the Western Hemisphere against European powers, but that it reserves the right to actively intervene in any country in the Western Hemisphere if civilization seems to depend on it. ",
            "The Roosevelt Corollary gives a formal definition to a whole new era of Pan American politics. By the time the corollary was issued in 1904, the Americans had already annexed Puerto Rico and occupied Cuba. And though Cuba would not be annexed, it would be occupied by the Marines three separate times between 1898 and 1922 and would then remain under close American supervision, really until Castro comes along. In 1903, Roosevelt broke Panama away from Columbia to bring the world’s dream of a central American canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to fruition. And as we just saw, the Dominican Republic had its finances managed by the United States starting in 1904. And that would be followed by an even deeper American military occupation that would last from 1916 to 1924. Nicaragua was occupied from 1912 to 1933. And while Honduras was never formally occupied, it was subjected to repeated marine incursions between 1903 and 1925. Most of this was done in support of American businesses, most especially the fruit companies like United Fruit and Standard Fruit. And it was from this era that the term Banana Republic emerged, coined by the writer O. Henry to describe the various Latin American governments who were all but subsidiaries of the American fruit companies, with the US Marines acting as company security. ",
            "But of interest to us here at the Revolution’s podcast are two military interventions in particular. One of them we won’t get to for a little while. But just know that in 1915, that is right smack dab in the middle of the Mexican revolution, the Americans invaded and occupied Veracruz. And there is a very good case to be made that this was the decisive turning point in the Mexican revolution. But we’ll have plenty of time to talk all about the guns of Veracruz when we get to the Mexican revolution, whenever we get to the Mexican revolution. But we are still today trying to wrap up the Haitian revolution. So we need to talk about the US occupation of Haiti, which ran from 1915 to 1934 and about which we are never told anything. ",
            "Now, the positively ancient President Alexis managed to get even more positively ancient and he managed to stay in power for six more years. But in December 1908, approaching now his 90th birthday, Alexis was put on the boat to Kingston. Following his departure, the Republic of Haiti entered a political death spiral, that would be helped along by American business and political interests eager to use the Roosevelt Corollary to make a fortune in Haiti. ",
            "In 1909, two US banks purchased a controlling interest in the National Bank of Haiti from the French, symbolically completing the transfer of foreign hegemony from the French to the Americans. Now, by the turn of the century, nearly three quarters of Haitian imports were now coming from the US rather than from France. And their loans also increasingly came from US banks. Debt servicing on those loans was now taking a staggering toll. By the 1890s, about 25% of the annual budget was being allotted to debt servicing. By 1898, that number was up to 50% and by 1915 it was fully 80%. That is 80% of Haiti’s tax revenue was immediately being handed off to its international creditors, which now meant the United States. What the Americans wanted to do was use Haiti’s outstanding debt as leverage to break the century old prohibition on foreign ownership. ",
            "But the Haitians remained fiercely proud of their independence and believed that prohibiting foreign ownership of their country was the centerpiece of that independence. And this was not some vague theory. The Haitians were watching the threat of foreign encroachment unfold before their very eyes. In 1910, the Haitian government wanted to complete a long stalled project to build a railroad linking Port-au-Prince to Le Cap. To get the job done, they granted very generous leasing terms to an American industrialist named James McDonald. McDonald’s company got a 50 year lease to a swath of land 12 miles wide, straddling the proposed rail line, where he would have near total autonomy to do whatever he wanted. McDonald planned to use this land to build a huge network of banana plantations. But this swath of land was not uninhabited wilderness. It was populated by communities and families who had lived there for generations. To clear the land, McDonald and the Haitian government began a program of forced dispossession. And since most of the families did not have clear title to the land, they had just been living there for 100 years, all of this was on the legal up and up. The dispossession, though, triggered resistance, revolts, and attacks on the project. McDonald, though, eventually gave up and handed the railroad off to the National Bank of Haiti, which was now, as we know, owned and operated by the United States. ",
            "Meanwhile, the Haitian national government itself was just failing. Between 1911 and 1915, seven different men served as president. Every one of them was quickly overthrown by a rival leader and then wound up either dead or on the boat to Kingston. And through each one of them, the Americans continued to pressure for more concessions and hinting darkly that it might be time to hand over control of the custom houses to responsible agents of the American government. And in fact, it was that pressure that helped destabilize each successive regime. Any president looking like he was about to give in to the Americans would be overthrown by populist insurgents. And any president who looked like he was about to stand up to the Americans quickly found rivals receiving American support. ",
            "In the midst of all this, a marine unit disembarked in Port-au-Prince in December 1914, walked into the National Bank of Haiti and removed $500,000 worth of gold deemed by American creditors to be no longer safe in Haitian hands. But since the bank was owned by Americans, this is not technically theft, right? Right. So the Americans then twisted the knife. The National Bank of Haiti would withhold all cash and loans from the Haitian government until they made the very sensible decision to open the country up to direct US investment. ",
            "The last straw finally broke in July of 1915. On July 27, 1915, the last preoccupation president of Haiti, Jean Guillaume Sam, tried to clamp down on domestic opposition to his just months old rule, by executing 167 political enemies and Port-au-Prince. Every one of those executed victims came from a prominent Haitian family, and the streets erupted in rage. Sam fled to the French embassy for protection, but a gang pushed their way in, beat him unconscious, and then threw his limp body into the streets, where he was torn to pieces by the mob. ",
            "The administration of Woodrow Wilson, who was now president of the United States and a great defender of democracy, the little guy and the right to national self determination, took the grisly murder of President Sam as the pretext the Americans needed to move in. On July 28, 1915, that is one day later, in case you’re wondering if these guys were just sitting around waiting for a pretext to invade, an American warship steamed into Port-au-Prince and offloaded a company of marines. The marines faced no resistance from the population, but no jolly welcome parties either. After securing Port-au-Prince, the marines went round and occupied each coastal city in turn, targeting especially the seizure and occupation of the customs houses. Between the National Bank of Haiti and the customs houses, the United States now controlled the finances of Haiti. The admiral in charge of the occupation then dug up a compliant puppet to serve as Haiti’s new president and dictated a convention that would technically be signed as a treaty between two sovereign powers, but which put Haiti under American administration. This administration would be run by a receiver general and a financial counselor who basically had unlimited authority to do whatever they wanted. Through a mix of carrots and sticks, the US induced the Haitian Senate to ratify the convention in November 1915. ",
            "Now, most of the Haitian army recognized that they were no match for the United States Marines and did not attempt to resist. But the commander down in Léogâne, a guy named Charlemagne Péralte, blocked the Marines’ approach to his city, and he refused to stand down. But this was, for now, just a gesture of protest. When he was fired for insubordination, Péralte quietly went home. For now. ",
            "Out in the rural areas, though, the irregular Cacos resisted the American invasion, and a brief flurry of guerrilla attacks met the Marines as they started to move inland. The first wave of resistance ended in November, though, just as the convention was being signed. ",
            "As I mentioned last week, one of the old forts built by Dessalines up in the northern mountains finally got some use, as a band of about 200 Cacos occupied it. But a small marine detachment led by Major Smedley Butler infiltrated the fort and took it without losing a single man. ",
            "Now, unfortunately, I don’t have time to wander off on a tangent about Smedley Butler, but if you’re bored one day, google Smedley Butler. S-M-E-D-L-E-Y. Butler. B-U-T-L-E-R. You can narrow the search by including such terms as ‘War is a Racket’ and ‘Gangster for Capitalism’. And when you’re done, you can move on to ‘Business Plot’. Have fun! ",
            "After taking control of Haiti, the Marines then wanted to build a network of modern roads to make their occupation more efficient, but amazingly could not find Haitian peasants who wanted to do the work. So the occupation authorities dusted off a law that had been on the book since 1864 that legalized corveé labor. Remember corveé labor from the very beginning of the French revolution? We talked about it way back in Episode 3.2. It was one of the most hated of all the feudal obligations, where local lords could compel peasants to work on public projects without pay or compensation. Apparently, not realizing that this law had never actually been used, the Marines just started conscripting Haitians to build roads for free under armed guard. So the Haitians were not just being paranoid when they said that the arrival of any foreign power would lead directly to re-enslavement. ",
            "Mostly what the Americans wanted, though, was to end the ban on foreign ownership. But they found that even their willing collaborators in the Haitian government did not want to give up this all important clause. The puppet president tried to outflank opposition in the Senate by calling for a new election in early 1917, only to find the election brought in even more opposition. The new Senate refused to even consider lifting the ban. So Major Smedley Butler led a unit of marines into the legislature and dispersed them at gunpoint. Viva democracy! ",
            "With the legislature dissolved, the Americans then proposed a new approach. Experts in Washington would draft a new constitution for Haiti and submit it as a public referendum. This new constitution would obviously drop the ban on foreign ownership, but it would also indemnify the Marines and any Haitian collaborators from criminal prosecution. And it also put all domestic power in the hands of the president, who would have the sole power to call for new legislative elections. The subsequent referendum vote was a complete farce. OK, check this out. For starters, the election was run by armed American Marines. Then, to deal with the fact that most of the population was illiterate, a white card dropped into the ballot box would be a yes vote and a black card would be a no vote. But you see, only the white cards were put out on the table to be picked up, you had to ask for the black card from the armed Marine who kept them in a little box under the table. So just shy of a hundred thousand people voted on the new constitution, which was about 5% of a population that now numbered about 2 million. The final tally: 98,294 yes to 769 no. Viva democracy! ",
            "Now, while this was all unfolding politically, the Americans were also totally reorganizing the Haitian military. The essence of it was to keep the rank and file soldiers in place, but replace all the officers with US Marines. This reorganized force was called the Gendarmerie, which is just a French name for an armed police force. The creation of this Gendarmerie, though, was important, not just as a tool to maintain the occupation, but it also fundamentally undid the old balance between Port-au-Prince in the outer districts and the rural urban split. Essentially, the Gendarmerie commanders took their orders from the central occupation authorities in Port-au-Prince without connection to or reliance on the local population they monitored. When the occupation ended, this centralized police state structure remained intact, with Haitian officers simply stepping back in to replace the departing Marines. This new military police model would, for the first time, make nationwide tyranny a real possibility. ",
            "But the creation of the Gendarmerie created as many problems as it solved. Those displaced Haitian officers obviously weren’t happy about any of this. And in October 1917, Charlemagne Péralte, the man who had been fired for standing his ground in Léogâne, was arrested on suspicion of fomenting revolt. Then, in September 1918, Péralte escaped from prison and did go into open revolt. Organizing the dissident Haitian officers and various Caco fighters in the north, Péralte started a true insurrectionary uprising, finding tons of new recruits amongst the totally ticked off corveé laborers. And as these things always go, the American Marines had no good way to tell insurgent combatant from peasant non combatant. And so their counter insurgency tactics became reckless and indiscriminate. Summary executions would often follow flimsy accusations. Entire villages would be burned on suspicion of aiding the rebels. The Americans also introduced the latest in military technology, using planes to drop bombs on suspected rebel hideouts, which were often, you know, just rural villages. This obviously created the same vicious cycle that the Leclerc Expedition ran into, where yesterday’s civilian becomes tomorrow’s insurgent after today’s atrocity. And the thing is, it’s not like every Haitian supported the insurgency. The rebel units usually acquired supplies by raiding and stealing from peaceful communities, strong-arming the population into supplying them. But most of those rural communities wound up hating the Americans more because of all this recklessly, indiscriminate repression. ",
            "Unable to defeat the insurgency, the Americans decided to cut the head off the snake. Two Marines and a local Haitian collaborator conspired to draw Péralte into a trap. They staged a fake battle where the collaborator was allowed to beat the Marines. Impressed, Péralte brought this guy into his inner circle. The collaborator then tipped off the two Marines about the location of Péralte’s house. The Marines snuck in one night and shot the rebel general dead. For this, they each received the Medal of Honor. Péralte’s body was then famously photographed, and copies of the pictures were dropped from planes all over Haiti to prove that the rebel chief was, in fact, dead. The active insurgency carried on for another year, but finally burned out in 1920. ",
            "The Americans occupied Haiti for the next decade. And given the state of American racial politics at the time, it should come as no surprise that many of the leaders of the occupation were crazy racist. And they wrote back home that the Haitians weren’t even children, like American negroes, the Haitians were little better than animals. The Americans tried to reintroduce large plantation economics, and up in the north, large scale sugar operations again, but the Haitians weren’t really having it. The occupation authorities concluded that this was because the population was too backward to understand modern farming techniques. But mostly we’re just back to *bleep*, you *bleep* hole. I’m not going to do it. ",
            "So all in all, it’s safe to say that the occupation of Haiti was wildly unpopular in Haiti. And during the occupation, tens of thousands of Haitians migrated out of the country, usually either across the island to the Dominican Republic or across the water to Cuba, only to find the US Marines were there too, and the only work to be done was on large scale industrial plantations. There was just no escaping it. ",
            "But all of this was becoming unpopular in the United States, too. In the wake of World War I, the interventionist-minded Roosevelt Corollary was giving way to a more isolationist sentiment in the United States. And in the 1920 election, part of the successful Republican platform was ending all these Caribbean occupations. Republican presidential candidate Warren Harding specifically cited the moral horror that was the rape of Haiti. So the final occupation in Cuba came to an end in 1922. The occupation of the Dominican Republic ended in 1924. The last incursion into Honduras also came in 1924. And by the end of the 1920s, American public opinion had turned decisively against international occupations. When Franklin Roosevelt was swept into office in 1932, he brought with him a rebuke of his famous cousin’s corollary that he called the good neighbor policy, which is just as friendly as it sounds. The occupation of Nicaragua then ended in 1932, and then finally, in 1934, the United States pulled out of Haiti. ",
            "But by the time Franklin Roosevelt came to power, though, the occupation in Haiti was already winding down. An anti-American demonstration in Les Cayes in December 1929 got out of hand, and the Marines wound up firing on a crowd, killing a dozen or more people. After this, the Americans clearly lost their taste for the occupation, and in 1930, the first elections in 15 years were held. And this time, the Marines were ordered to stay in their barracks. But though anti-occupation leaders naturally swept these elections, they did lay the groundwork for the continuation of American business in the country, even after the American Marines pulled out, offering, for example, a monopoly on banana export to standard fruit. The constitution written by the Americans was replaced in 1932 by a new constitution that returned Haiti to its standard form of President, Senate, and chamber of deputies. But critically, the ban on foreign ownership was not brought back. So even as the last of the Marines pulled out in 1934, American business interests stayed behind. ",
            "But unfortunately, the aftermath of all these American occupations led to an era of ruthless dictatorships throughout the Caribbean. This was the era that saw the rise of, among others, Batista in Cuba, Somoza in Nicaragua, and then over in the Dominican Republic, Rafael Trujillo, who came to power in 1930 and would stay in power until he was assassinated in 1961. Trujillo was particularly ruthless, and he developed a tightly controlled military dictatorship that employed modern methods of fascist propaganda to create a cult of personality that would soon be emulated in Haiti’s own coming dictatorial nightmare run by Papa Doc Duvalier. ",
            "Trujillo’s atrocities intersected with the history of Haiti directly in 1937. After reaching a seemingly innocuous treaty with the Haitians, firmly establishing the border between the two countries, Trujillo went home and said that he intended to purge all Haitians who had happened to have migrated to his side of the island. But this was not about forcing them to return home. Trujillo sent his armed forces up into the borderlands. They closed the border and then proceeded to systematically massacre every Haitian they found. In English, this is called the Parsley Massacre. Now, the number remains hotly disputed to this day, but anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 people were killed in just a few days over October 1937. ",
            "Now, this particular massacre though, was more or less swept under the rug. And like a good neighbor, the United States helped broker a small restitution payment by Trujillo to the Haitians, where nobody really admitted what had just happened. And unfortunately, in a few years, the Haitians would have their own far greater horrors to contend with. ",
            "Now, though, the United States had pulled out of Haiti, the two presidents who ran the country from 1930 to 1946 were both drawn from the colored elite, and they maintained strong ties to the United States. During World War II, Haiti declared war on the Axis and tried to make itself an indispensable source of rubber for the Allies. But the plan to turn Haiti into a rubber factory failed both economically and socially. Like the McDonald railroad contract, forced dispossession of the rural poor to make way for rubber plantations caused unrest and havoc. And once the war ended, the market for rubber dried up anyway. ",
            "Then, in the summer of 1946, another little revolutionary upswing took hold. Student-led demonstrations ousted the US backed government and brought a black leader into power for the first time since before the US occupation. This guy’s name was Dumarsais Estimé. But unlike previous revolutionary youth movements, these new guys were not fired up by classical liberalism, but rather left wing communist ideology. They were part of a wider pan American rise of leftist opposition to the capitalist imperialism of the United States that was turning all their governments into stooges of the damn Yankee bankers. ",
            "But this new left leaning black government of Estimé ran into the double problem of the country being too broke to deliver on any of its social promises, and the all powerful United States hunkering down for the Cold War and thus not having any interest in helping out a bunch of radical leftists in Haiti. Attacked from the right for being too far to the left and from the left for being too far to the right, Estimé soon lost favor and abdicated in 1950, giving way to a general named Paul Magloire, who immediately reversed course and secured favorable treatment from the US by running a stridently anti-communist regime. When Magloire then tried to extend his term of office beyond its constitutional limit in 1956, his opponents united to drive him out of office. ",
            "Now, after this, it looked like the presidency was either going to go to Louis Déjoie, representing the wealthy colored elite, or a massively popular leftist labor leader and former math teacher named Daniel Fignolé. But instead, luck, cunning, and violence brought in dark horse candidate François Duvalier to power. ",
            "François Duvalier was a medical doctor by training and a member of a black nationalist intellectual movement that had emerged during and after the US occupation. His main claim to fame before becoming president was the leading role he had played in a UN relief effort to wipe out a particular tropical skin disease, which earned him international acclaim and lots of support in the rural areas where he had worked, hence his nickname, Papa Doc Duvalier. ",
            "But Duvalier was not a nice guy, and he had zero political scruples. He saw an opportunity to seize the presidency in the chaotic 1957 election, and he took it. But he didn’t do it with speeches and promises. Instead, he organized these anonymous armed gangs called the Masks, because they wore masks to intimidate, assault, and kill Duvalier’s opponents. After left wing Daniel Fignolé was exiled from the country by his rightwing opponents in the military, Duvalier shoved his way in and with the help of his masked thugs, won the election in September 1957. After his inauguration, Duvalier wasted no time cloaking himself in a mystical cult of personality that soon had him claiming to be the living personification of Haiti and stoking rumors that he might actually have Voodoo power. ",
            "But Duvalier didn’t have any Voodoo power. He just had a brand of political terrorism that made him one of the most infamous dictators in history. Once in power, he reorganized the government to make it purely authoritarian and then reorganized the Masks, turning them into a private police force that was officially called the National Security Volunteers, but which everyone else called the Tonton Macoute, after a particularly scary Voodoo monster who devoured children. ",
            "During Duvalier’s reign, the Tonton Macoute embarked on a campaign of deliberately random terror. Abducting, killing, raping, vandalizing, all without warning and often for no real reason. Duvalier also secured for himself the power to suspend civil rights any time he declared a state of siege, which he would randomly declare whenever he wanted. In 1961, Duvalier then staged a referendum to extend his presidential term to 1967, using the trick that the Marines had once used. You had to tell the armed Tonton Macoute which ballot you wanted, the yes ballot or the no ballot, and nobody asked for the no ballot. ",
            "Now, ironically, the Kennedy administration was so incensed by this that they cut off aid and withdrew the American ambassador, even though this was literally from the manual of the US occupation, not 40 years old. ",
            "But Duvalier got back into American good graces by embracing an anti-communist front, and anyone even remotely left wing were prime targets for the Tonton Macoute. But all this terror did not fully clamp down on opposition, and the usual round of rural insurrections broke out during Duvalier’s reign and plagued him as much as they had plagued any Haitian president. Believing that the Dominicans were aiding these rebels, Duvalier burned a huge line along the border and ordered his men to kill anyone who stepped foot in the no man’s land. Then another insurrection, led by American educated and trained guerrillas, started down in the south in 1963, but was quickly crushed. ",
            "The following year, Duvalier then held another public referendum, this time to make him president for life. And for this election, he dispensed with all democratic pretensions. Only one preprinted yes ballot was issued. Your job as a voter was to pick it up and drop it in the ballot box. From a population now numbering about 3.8 million, Duvalier claimed in this way 2.8 million yes votes. Though, a few thousand defaced ballots with the word no scribbled on it did show up. ",
            "Now, life for everyday Haitians during the Duvalier era was very difficult. The rural population struggled from long neglect and unsustainable environmental degradation. As the population grew, the interior mountains just stayed put, forcing people to clear steeper and steeper grades of land or overtax what little land they had, leaving the soil severely depleted. But the really big problem now was deforestation. ",
            "Deforestation had been a threat for a long time, especially as the easy cash to be made from exporting firewood had made logging an easy business to get into. I didn’t mention this, but on Dessalines’s final tour of the south, right before he was assassinated, he was actually cracking down on the illegal exportation of firewood. But even as late as the American occupation, probably two thirds of Haiti’s natural forests were still intact. But after World War II, everything hit critical mass. Hurricane Hazel came through in 1954 and dealt a debilitating blow to the forest, and it was kind of all downhill from there. And by this point, it wasn’t even primarily because of over exportation, because Haiti’s chief source of fuel was and remains, charcoal. So as the population grew and grew and grew, more trees had to be cut down. And if you Google a map of Haiti right now, today, you can literally see the problem. Something like 98% of the indigenous forests have now been wiped out, leading to mass soil erosion, mineral depletion, and regular unstoppable flooding. ",
            "So during the Duvalier era, the hard pressed rural population had to either move to the cities in search of work contributing to the mass overcrowding of Port-au-Prince, or seasonally migrate over to the Dominican Republic factory farms. But to get there, they had to buy a work permit from the government, and then the Dominican plantation owners had to match that fee. This all created a huge slush fund for Duvalier, who was now basically leasing his people to the Dominican Republic. ",
            "Meanwhile, the urban centers were now kept under close watch for any seditious activity, leading almost every educated professional to find an opportune moment to pack up and leave the country. Something like four fifths of the educated professionals and their families abandoned Haiti during the Duvalier era. And this is not good if you’re trying to maintain some kind of stable and functioning economy. And this is to say nothing of the now tens of thousands of rural and urban poor who also fled the country, becoming the so-called boat people that Americans saw on the evening news a lot in the 1970s and 1980s. And what is now called the Haitian diaspora, by the time Baby Doc Duvalier was overthrown in 1986, roughly 1 million Haitians had left the country. And while I’m here doing some numbers, I should also mention that it’s reckoned that somewhere between 30,000 and 60,000 people were either killed or just vanished by the Tonton Macoute during Duvalier’s reign. ",
            "By 1971, Papa Doc Duvalier’s health was failing, and so he held yet another referendum on the right of his 19 year old son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, to succeed him as president for life. I don’t even think that there were ballots for this one. It was just unanimous approval. Then just a few months later, in April 1971, Papa Doc Duvalier died – a useless piece of garbage if ever there was one. He brought with him nothing but murder and terror. He did nothing for his people but wreck an already poor country even more than it had already been wrecked. His son, soon dubbed Baby Doc Duvalier, was not much better, though the worst heat of the terror seemed to have been replaced by a low, constant flame of repressive political tactics. Though the Tonton Macoute were as omnipresent and horrible as ever. Their ranks had swollen to include 300,000, and they were eating up two thirds of the annual national budget. ",
            "Baby Doc Duvalier, though, was little more than a pampered playboy, who had been just seven years old when his father had seized power and had grown up a prince, living fat on the profits from the government’s, that is the Duvalier family’s, monopoly on tobacco exports. But the Duvalier family anti-communism kept them inoculated from US pressures to reform, and American business interests moved into Port-au-Prince, using cheap labor to manufacture all kinds of consumer products for American consumption, including, and I did not know this, every single baseball used in Major League Baseball between 1977 and 1990. Rawlings had a factory in Port-au-Prince when they became the official baseball supplier in 1977, and that factory would remain there for 13 years before relocating to Costa Rica in 1990, citing political instability. And I can’t really say that I blame them. ",
            "So Baby Doc finally came under some pressure to ease up on the tyranny when notorious do-gooder Jimmy Carter was elected president. In the late 1970s were a little tiny flowering of openness that was violently shut again in 1981 when President Reagan replaced Carter. And once again, the Duvalier family anti-communism took precedence in American foreign policy calculations. ",
            "But eventually, the toll of nearly 30 years of brutal dictatorship finally brought the Duvaliers down. A swine flu epidemic in the early 1980s was countered by the mass slaughter of every pig in the country, which turned out to be one of those the-cure-is-worse-than-the-disease things. And by then, the AIDS epidemic was beginning to take hold, and nobody knew what it was or how to stop it. Protests and demonstrations in the mid-1980s finally peaked in 1986, leading to violent reprisals by the Tonton Macoute. But this time, the reprisals opened the floodgates of public rage instead of shutting it all down. Overwhelmed, Baby Doc Duvalier tried to hang on, but everyone in the country now wanted him gone. Even the Reagan administration told him, “Yeah, it’s time for you to go”. The US air Force was kind enough to fly him off to exile in Paris, though, where he would soon lose all his ill gotten wealth to a bitter divorce proceedings and then live in modest exile for the next 25 years, fending off periodic attempts by the French to get rid of him. He would, for some reason, then return to Haiti in 2011, whereupon Duvalier was arrested for corruption, and he was still waiting to be brought to trial when he died of a heart attack in October 2014. Good riddance. ",
            "So that brings us up more or less to contemporary Haiti, where the history is almost too recent to objectively analyze, though one guy does stand out as the dominant personality, and that’s Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Aristide was born and raised during the Duvalier era, went to seminary and was ordained a priest in 1982 and he brought with him to the pulpit liberation theology, which actively promoted social justice and a defense of the poor against the exploitation of rich and powerful elites. So naturally, Aristide quickly ran into trouble with the Duvalier regime and was forced into a three year exile that he spent mostly in Montreal. But with anti-Duvalier sentiment spreading, Aristide returned to Haiti in 1985 and gave a famous mass during Easter week that helped galvanize the opposition. ",
            "But when Baby Doc was finally driven into exile in 1986, power first passed into the hands of a provisional council of government composed of three civilians and three military leaders who oversaw the first supposedly free election since the Duvaliers had come to power. But what followed then was a quick run of coups and counter coups. The guy elected president in January 1988 got into it with the head of the army about who really controlled the officer corps, and the head of the army proved his point by deposing the new president in a coup. Meanwhile, in the background of all this, the old Duvalier loyalists and senior leaders of the Tonton Macoute were still just hanging around and eyeing their own return to power. In July, a land reform movement started up in the north that was opposed by one of the huge landowners in the region. The military government endorsed this guy’s right to keep all of his land and do with it as he saw fit, and with this blessing in hand, use paramilitary forces, mostly old Tonton Macoute, to attack the land reform activists on July 23, 1988, killing at least 140 and probably more than that. ",
            "As this was unfolding, Aristide was busy dodging multiple assassination attempts and continuing to rail against the old tyrannical powers that still seem to rule Haiti, even though the Duvaliers were now gone. And he wasn’t wrong. On September 11, 1988, Aristide was set to give mass to 1,000 parishioners in the poor Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Saint-Jean when a group of about 100 old Tonton Macoute pushed their way in and opened fire with machine guns. When the crowd broke up in panic, these guys then let fly with the machetes. And while Aristide himself escaped, at least a dozen people were killed and close to 100 injured, and the church burned to the ground. And then the perpetrators of all this, called now the Saint-Jean massacre, were allowed to go on TV and not just defend what they had done, but promise even more blood if Aristide ever gave another mass. ",
            "In response to this, a group of young non-commissioned officers staged a coup of their own on September 29, 1988. They said it was to bring honor back to Haiti, but then they handed power off to General Prosper Avril. The irony here is that Avril was himself an old inner circle member of the Duvalier regime. He was, in fact, their principal agent for foreign affairs, and when he came to power, he did not restore the honor of Haiti so much as bring back the Duvaliers, without the Duvaliers. He ruled for three years, and in that time pretty brazenly executed and tortured his political opponents into submission. By 1990, Avril ran out of steam, and he was tossed out after a wave of street protests in Port-au-Prince. An interim government then oversaw the first really free and open election in Haitian history. And in late 1990, Jean-Bertrand Aristide won in a walk with 67% of the vote. But since this is Haiti, there are no happy endings. ",
            "Aristide embarked on a program of widespread reform that, among other things, tried to investigate all the atrocities committed by the Tonton Macoute and then shut down the massive amount of cocaine being funneled through the country from Colombia with the help and protection of senior Haitian military and political leaders. And since we’re now basically in current events rather than history, it’s hard to, for example, assess how deeply the CIA was involved in the Haitian cocaine trade. But for sure, after the fall of Baby Doc Duvallier, the CIA helped organize, train, and partially fund a new intelligence service for Haiti called the SIN. This new intelligence service was trained for work and counternarcotics, but then all those same guys turn up on a list of all the chief narcotics traffickers in Haiti, including the chief of the Port-au-Prince police force. ",
            "Many of these principal players then got together in September 1991 and staged a coup that drove Aristide out of the country. The presumption being that he was probably about to crack down on their activities. These guys then set up a little military regime that was not recognized by the rest of the world. And the Americans responded by embargoing Haiti, which had the rotten side effect of throwing tens of thousands of Port-au-Prince factory workers out on the streets. Rawlings had already packed up and left the year before.",
            "In 1994, President Clinton then secured a UN resolution to support ‘Operation: Uphold Democracy’ to put the democratically elected Aristide back in power. The US armed forces started mustering to go in. And a little three man commission of ex-President Jimmy Carter, ex-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell, and Senator Sam Nunn talked the little narco military regime into giving up rather than face the full brunt of a US invasion. With this regime headed into exile, the United States once again sent its military forces in to occupy Haiti, this time restoring Aristide to power. The following year, the restored Aristide then took the huge step, and I’m not really sure how he managed to pull this off, of just straight up disbanding the Haitian army, converting its disbanded pieces into a domestic police force on the one hand, and a coast guard on the other. The army that had been so instrumental in dictating the course of Haitian history and not always, like for the better, was now no more. It’s still no more. Haiti right now, today does not have an army. So, happy ending for Haiti, right? ",
            "Aristide was succeeded in 1996 by a longtime ally named René Préval, who had himself been a part of the Haitian diaspora during the Duvalier era. And though he and Aristide had a falling out over Préval’s willingness to privatize various government services in an attempt on the one hand, to improve the economy, and on the other, to satisfy Haiti’s international creditors. But their falling out wasn’t so bad because in the year 2000, Aristide’s new political party won the election, and power was successfully transferred from Préval to Aristide, which, as you may have noticed, like never happens in the history of Haitian politics. ",
            "Now, there were some irregularities in the 2000 election, but nothing that came close to the stuff that we’ve already talked about here today. It was during his second term as president that Aristide then started beating the drum that the French really ought to pay Haiti back for the indemnity that had so crippled the country back in the 19th century. Aristide put the bill at $21 billion. And this may come as a shock, but France isn’t interested in paying it back. ",
            "But as had happened with his first term in office, Aristide did not make it through his second term. In 2004, a prominent gang leader was assassinated, and his family blamed Aristide, so they changed the name of their gang from the Cannibal Army to the National Revolutionary Front and organized all of Aristide’s enemies against him. These guys seized Gonaïves and then Le Cap, and then as their forces marched south, heavy pressure was brought to bear on Aristide to resign before a bloodbath commenced. So Aristide signed a vague letter of resignation and got on an American plane that flew him off to the Central African Republic, and eventually he would settle into exile in South Africa. ",
            "But he soon began claiming that he had done none of this willingly, that he had been basically kidnapped by the Americans who wanted him out of the way. And the Americans said, “No, that is a lie. You got on the plane willingly and you know it.” I have literally no position on this. I’m just telling you that this is what the two sides are saying. ",
            "So now we’re practically right on top of events. In 2006, a kind of/mostly/pretty good election brought René Préval back to power. And so he’s the guy who got to deal with the string of disasters that we’re going to wrap all of this up with. ",
            "In 2008, world grain prices shot through the roof, and there were food riots in Port-au-Prince. And then this was followed by the really, really big blow. On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7 earthquake hit about 16 miles west of Port-au-Prince. The overcrowded metro area of the capital now numbered some 2 million. And most of these people were living in structures that could not hope to stand up to repeated wacks with a baseball bat, let alone a magnitude 7 earthquake. And this is to say nothing of the long neglected infrastructure of Haiti, which was just destroyed. Roads, bridges, hospitals, phone lines, water, sanitation – everything was just wiped out. From the poorest, shanty towns to the presidential palace, the destruction in Haiti was vast and deadly. And since the infrastructure was wiped out, it was also nearly impossible for anyone to help anyone else. The final death toll was put at a low of 50,000, with a high of 300,000, and at least 1.5 million people displaced. The country is still not even close to recovering from this disaster, which was then exacerbated by a cholera outbreak. Which we’ve just recently found out is very likely linked to unsanitary conditions at a UN aid station near one of the principal watersheds during the recovery efforts. And since I just read about that a couple of days ago, that seems like a pretty good moment to end the history of Haiti. ",
            "So today, Haiti is, as everyone is contractually obligated to point out when talking about Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. They got there through a mix of the world screwing them over a lot, their own political and economic mistakes and then environmental catastrophes caused both by God and their own hands. But they will never not be the country that was born from the only successful slave uprising in the history of the world. That they had been created by a group of men and women who would not be slaves anymore, who beat back every major world power who tried to come in and tell them how it was going to be. The history of Haiti is not pretty and Haiti is not in great shape right now. But I’m proud to know them, proud to know their history and proud to have shared it here with you over the course of this series. And I hope that from now on, whenever you encounter news about Haiti, you feel a better connection to the country and understand them a little better, because they deserve to be more to us than just the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. They were once the avengers of the New World. ",
            "Now I’ll end this all by turning the clock back all the way to 1815. President Alexandre Pétion was told that a freedom fighter from the Spanish main had failed in his most recent attempt to win independence from the Spanish empire and that he and his companions had landed in Les Cayes on Christmas Eve 1815. Pétion gladly welcomed this dashing 32 year old colonial aristocrat to Port-au-Prince, and over repeated meetings, the two men became friends. They shared a Republican vision for the Americas that would one day see them all free of European tyranny. To help the would-be liberator of Spanish America return home to continue the fight, Pétion gave him and his companions seven fully crude ships, 1,000 guns and 30,000 pounds of gunpowder. It would not be enough to win, but it would be enough to continue the fight. And of course, you’ve known since I started telling you this story that dashing freedom fighter down on his luck was Simón Bolívar, who did indeed return home and continue the fight, thanks to timely aid from the Republic of Haiti. And when the Revolutions podcast returns on June 5, I am going to tell you all about it.",
